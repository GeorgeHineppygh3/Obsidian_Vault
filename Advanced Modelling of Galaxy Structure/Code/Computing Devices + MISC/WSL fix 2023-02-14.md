## What has gone wrong?

Began using WSL and had success with executing the code. Built understanding until created python file (Documentation: [gax_fits.py](../Code%20description/Python%20files/gax_fits.py.md) ) which functions are called from into testing Jupyter notebook (Documentation [Borge_test.ipynb](../../../PDF%20exports/Borge_test.ipynb.md)). 

After creating function to read in images into composite multiband arrays (`Read_M_band(file_name)`) decided wanted to attempt running a small loop by transferring the `.fits` files into the folder structure within ubuntu. 

First attempt: tried dragging and dropping all $146,000$ files from the `D:` drive to the ubuntu `/home/borge/face_on_spiral_objects` - unsurprisingly this didn't work and seemingly only some of the files transferred leaving approximately 67,000 files in the `face_on_spiral_objects` folder.

After doing this any subsequent attempts to transfer files failed due to the write protection in the ubuntu drives.


In order to leave a complete file system inside the ubuntu folder I went in via the terminal to the folder and added write privileges to the folder and files and then removed them. 

After this I then mounted the `D:` drive to copy over the `.tgz` files into the ubuntu directory. The `.tgz` files were then found there. 

After this I then decided to extract the `.tgz` files  inside the ubuntu folder.

figure shows the ubuntu destination folder with 4/5 band `.tgz` files in (human error not computer) with sub folder `face_on_spiral_objects` which contains the extraction from the `_ga.tgz` file.

figure shows the ubuntu sub folder with the extraction inside it - everything set to read only

after this I wanted to rename the file to G_band or something more sensible - tried to do this with the mv command but had no success.

after doing this extraction could not extract any other `.tgz` files:
tried running
```
tar zxvf face_on_spiral_objects_ia.tgz
```
but it returns
![Pasted image 20230214141248.png](../../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230214141248.png)

I then tried changing the write privileges of everything in the folder but it did not work.

I then returned to VS-code to find:
![Pasted image 20230214141354.png](../../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230214141354.png)


## What to do to fix it:

### Options:
1. wait for dad
2. rebuild WSL

## What have we done since?

identified that have run out of inodes for the cdrive mount - need to format the Linux drive

formatting will take place 2023-02-15 12:00 ish - 
success and all files saved so 


# no issues in rebuild!!!!

## Crashed again 2023-02-15

This worked until I tried to install conda through Linux with the following:

`$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh`

returning this:

![Pasted image 20230216125914.png](../../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230216125914.png)

After this I changed the permissions of the downloaded file so that it can execute.

`borge@Borge:~$ chmod +x Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh`

after this I then executed the file with

`borge@Borge:~$ sh ./Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh`

returning

![Pasted image 20230216130327.png](../../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230216130327.png)
I then confirmed the location; which returned:

![Pasted image 20230216130504.png](../../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230216130504.png)

and now VS-code returns the error:
![Pasted image 20230216130533.png](../../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230216130533.png)
