After we can run the code we will want to measure how much of the image of the arms makes up of the total flux from the source.

In order to measure the proportion of flux (e.g. U band) from the arms we require:
$$U_{frac} = \\frac{U_{arm}}{U_{source}}$$
where $U_{frac}$ is the fraction of flux emitted from the arms to the total source flux.

Not sure if would have to remove the average background as it would not affect the above pure fraction. Removal of background may be necessary however if there are any more complex solutions.

Need to be able to isolate and calculate the amount of flux from the source.
