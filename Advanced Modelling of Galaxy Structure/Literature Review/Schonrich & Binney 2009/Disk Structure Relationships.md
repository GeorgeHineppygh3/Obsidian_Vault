'The mere existence of a galactic disk has two basic implications. First, the gas from which the disk formed must have settled into circular orbits before the disk stars were born; once a star is formed its future path is determined entirely by gravitational forces, and gravity cannot circularize a random distribution of stellar orbits. Second, since the disk formed, the gravitational field has not undergone any sudden, dramatic changes, which would disrupt the circular pattern of stellar orbits. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the mass distribution, and hence the gravitational field, has evolved slowly.' *- Joshua E Barns* 

- The more massive a star, the brighter it shines, the bluer its colour, and the shorter its lifetime.
- The broadband colours of a galaxy depend largely on the rate of star formation averaged over the last ~ $10^8\\;yr$ 
-  higher rates of star formation yield bluer colours
- gas constitutes < $15\\%$ of mas of stars in a galaxy
- Some of the gas invested in stars is returned to the galactic reservoir as the stars age, having been enriched in metals (elements heavier than H and He)
- bulk of the mass in the spheroid component (BULGE)
- On the average, older stars have larger random velocities; for stars less than $10^9$ Years old, rms velocities toward or away from the galactic centre are $\\sigma_R \\, \\approx 10\\, km\\, s^1$, while for the oldest disk start, we find $\\sigma_R \\, \\approx 40-60\\, km\\, s^1$.
- The most likely explanation for the trend of random velocity with age is that stars are born on nearly circular orbits, and are subsequently deflected onto more random orbits by fluctuations in the galactic gravitational field.
- Lyman Spitzer, Jr. and Martin Schwarzschild postulated the existence of giant molecular clouds.
- Present calculations indicate that clouds of mass $10^6\\,M_\\odot$ can produce random velocities of up to ~ 30 km $s^{-1}$ 
- According to the accretion hypothesis, spiral galaxies are susceptible to starvation: If the inflow of raw material for new stars is cut off, the spiral soon fades, leaving a smooth disk resembling an SO galaxy.
- SO galaxies are generally found in high-density regions where starvation is likely
- Disk Galaxy in dense cluster may fall victim to starvation due to removal of interstellar material by the ram pressure of the hot, low-density gas pervading such clusters. Alternatively, the overpressure of the cluster gas may compress molecular clouds within the galaxy, provoking a burst of rapid star formation - could explain unusually blue galaxies in high redshift clusters
- disk galaxy may ingest a companion - interactions between galaxies often result in mergers the outcome depending on the mass ratio of the colliding systems. Large disk galaxies can swallow small companions, of less than ~ 10% their mass, with only minor damage: Random motions of disk stars increase, and the disks become thicker.
