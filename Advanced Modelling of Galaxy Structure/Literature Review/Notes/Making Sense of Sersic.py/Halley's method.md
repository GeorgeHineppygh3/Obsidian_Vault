Edmond Halley was an English mathematician who introduced the method now called by his name. Halley's method is a numerical algorithm for solving the nonlinear equation _f_(_x_) = 0. In this case, the function _f_ has to be a function of one real variable. The method consists of a sequence of iterations:
$$ x_{n+1}=x_n - \\frac{2f(x_n)f'(x_n)}{2[f'(x_n)]^2\\,-\\, f(x_n)f''(x_n)}$$
