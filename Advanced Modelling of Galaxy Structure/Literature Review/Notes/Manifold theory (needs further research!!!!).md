### Abstract:
- demonstrated that for a two arm spiral galaxy the phase space structure near corotation is shaped to a large extent by the invariant manifolds of the short period family of unstable periodic orbits terminating at $L_1$ or $L_2$.
- Manifolds create robust phase correlations among a number of chaotic orbits large enough to support a spiral density wave outside corotation
- solution comes in the form of a Sine-Gordon equation.
- N body simulations demonstrate the projection of unstable manifolds reproduces the entire observed bar-spiral pattern.

### Conclusion:
- Phases = positions of the apocenters
- while the orbits initially in the manifold are unstable and chaotic the phases for a group of particles populating the manifold remain correlated for quite long times
- As long as the galaxyâ€™s pattern slows down, the manifolds become gradually more open and the bundles of preferential directions become broader, but still the connection between manifold and spiral geometry is preserved
