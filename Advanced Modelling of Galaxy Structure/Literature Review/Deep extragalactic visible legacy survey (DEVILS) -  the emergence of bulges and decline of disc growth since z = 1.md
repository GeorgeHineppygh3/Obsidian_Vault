1. in redshift range 0 - 1 general growth in stellar mass density (SMD) of a factor of 1.5
2. disc consists of ~ 60% of SMD (0.8 <z <0.2) dropping to ~ 30% at z = 0.0
3. elliptical bulgs grow from 20% to 30% of SMD in galaxies with overall growth factor 2.5
4. all three classes of spheroids have grown over the past 8Gyr
5. infer that spheroid forming processes and pathways appear to dominate mass transformation vs disc growth


conclusions:

1. discs dominate the SMD at all redshifts
