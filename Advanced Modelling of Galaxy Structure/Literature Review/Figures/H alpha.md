H α emission originates from ionized gas regardless of how the gas was ionized. In normal H II regions, atomic hydrogen is photoionized by the UV emission from O/B stars. Photoionization does not significantly affect the overall kinematics of the gas relative to old stars and the neutral gas in the vicinity. We expect the velocity obtained from H α emission of these photoionized sources to be relatively similar to the velocity of the bulk of the baryons, which is mostly governed by gravitational forces. In dynamical modelling of a galaxy merger using collisionless test particles only gravitational effects are to be considered. So, we expect H α kinematics of normal H II regions to be ideal for our modelling method
