The Nuker profile, characterised by an inner and outer power-law profile smoothly merged around a break radius.

$$ I(R)=2^{\\frac{\\beta - \\gamma}{\\alpha}}\\, I_b \\, \\bigg(\\frac{R}{R_b}\\bigg)^{-\\gamma}\\,\\bigg[1+\\bigg(\\frac{R}{R_b}\\bigg)^{\\alpha}\\bigg]^{\\frac{\\gamma - \\beta}{\\alpha}}$$

In this formula, _R_ is the circular radius on the plane of the sky, $R_b$ is the break radius that indicates the transition between the inner and the outer profile, $I_b = I(R_b)$ is the surface brightness at the break radius, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ correspond to the negative logarithmic surface brightness slopes at large and small radii respectively, and $\\alpha$ is a parameter that sets the width of the transition between the inner and outer profiles. This model has become generally known in the extragalactic community as the Nuker model.
