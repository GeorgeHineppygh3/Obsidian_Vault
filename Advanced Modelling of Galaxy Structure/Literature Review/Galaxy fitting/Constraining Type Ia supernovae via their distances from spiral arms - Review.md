### Un-defined Terms:
- SNe: Supernovae
- $\\Delta m_{15}$ : Light curve decline rate

### Abstract:
- analysed 77 1a SNe relative to spiral arms of Sab-Scd galaxies
- Studied distance to the spiral arms in reference to their light curve decline rate ($\\Delta m_{15}$ )
- Found smaller $\\Delta m_{15}$ with SNe located closer to spiral arms compared to interarm decline rates [Could we use this to check the non parametric fitting extraction by measuring 1a SNe inside and outside the fit?]
- Demonstrate correlation between the distance of SNe to spiral arms and their galacto-concentric radii before and after corotation radius
- SNe are found at the inner and outer edge shock fronts of spiral arms
- explain correlation in terms of the sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf explosion models and density wave theory where the SN distances from the shock front are appropriate progenitor lifetime/age indicators

### Conclusion:
- Study is good but only includes 77 galaxies and so needs larger statistical studies with larger more robust datasets IE IFU observations to better constrain the nature of the SNe 1a progenitor
