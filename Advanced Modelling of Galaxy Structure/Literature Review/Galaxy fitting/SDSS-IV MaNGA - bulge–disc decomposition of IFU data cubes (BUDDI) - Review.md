### Abstract:

- Uses large IFU spectral surveys of nearby galaxies
- present bulge–disc decomposition of IFU data cubes - BUDDI
- Fit galaxy profiles using GALFITm
- new method is better because each component can be constrained using knowledge over the whole image and spectrum available
- Data came from SDSS-IV and MaNGA surveys with $z<0.14$ and below $1.5\\, r_e$ at $2.5 \\, arcsec$ spatial resolution 

### Conclusion:

- demonstrated a method for bulge disc decomposition using IFU's 
- full spectral information through the data cube and the increased signal to noise over the whole data set when applying simultaneous fits
- tests found that GALFITm improved the extraction of information, particularly at low S/N
- Galaxies were split into two early type galaxy structures:
	- light and mass weighted stellar populations were measured for a decomposed bulge and a non decomposed
		- the decomposed spectra were found to be less noisy than and consistent with those from the radially binned data cubes
		- Not sure on this section I don't think I have understood it correctly
- Non parametric feature is mentioned in this paper
- analysis presented in this paper is able to measure colour gradients within each component through the variation in the effective radius of that component with radius - degeneracy between age and metallicity prevents this information from being translated into stellar population gradients
- by allowing the effective radii to be free with wavelength in the fits of long-slit spectra, the line index gradients could be measured and used to derive gradients in the ages and metallicities (Johnston 2012)
- Combining the metallicity work of 2012 this could be used for predicting evolutions by looking at metallicity as a function of radius
