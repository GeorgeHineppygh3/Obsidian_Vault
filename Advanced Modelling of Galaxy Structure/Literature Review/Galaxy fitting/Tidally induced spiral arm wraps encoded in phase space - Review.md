### Abstract:
- distant tidal approach induces two-armed spiral structure
- The arms correspond to regions with average galactocentric radial velocity
- pattern speed rotates with $\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa$ which depends on GCR causing a winding with time
- winding produces ridges in the $R-V_\\phi$ projection with alternating and oscillating $V_R$  in the $L_z-\\phi$ space
- The frequency of the kinematic features increases with time creating possible inferences of potential and perturbation evolutions
- Using Fourier analysis the dating of the origin of oscillations and presence of perturbations demonstrates passages by perturbing objects
- Assuming due to distant tidal interactions the timescales for the perturbation occur at $<0.6\\,Gyr$ for impulse induced and $0.8-2.1\\,Gyr$ for passages


### Conclusion:

1. impulsive distant tidal impact generates an initial quadrupole in velocities that leads to a two-armed spiral structure that winds up with time at an approximate rate of $\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa$. The arms progressively have smaller pitch angles and there is an increasing number of spiral wraps in a particular azimuth in the disc with time.
2. The location of the maximum density (locus of the arms) coincides with regions where the average galactocentric radial velocity is negative, and the azimuthal velocity with respect to the average at each radius is zero. This is because the arms coincide with orbital phases in-between apocentre and pericentre.
3. The winding up of the spiral arms and the associated velocity pattern produce a global wave in $V_R$ that depends on azimuth, manifesting as inclined stripes in the $L_Z-\\phi$ plane, and as oscillations of $V_R$ as a function of $L_Z$ in a given region of the disc, as observed also in the Gaia data. The wavelength of this oscillation decreases with time (and with $L_Z$ at a fixed time). This wave is seen as a pattern of stripes with alternating signs of $V_R$ in the $R-V_\\phi$ projection. Each stripe with negative $V_R$ corresponds to a spiral arm wrap.
4. In the $R-V_\\phi$ plane, a sawtooth shape appears, with increasing number of oscillations with time. Each oscillation is associated to a spiral wrap, but the stars that belong to the arms do not lie on the down-going ridges but on the regions with negative radial velocity in this projection. The sawtooth shape is diluted in more complex models such as N-body and when multiple mechanisms are at play.
5. The relation between density and average velocities (and associated ridges and waves in phase space) is different for other models of spiral arms, offering a way to distinguish between different dynamical models of arms.
6. With the realistic simulation of the interaction between Sagittarius and the MW, we see that the first three pericentres of Sagittarius seem close to the impulsive and distant tide approximation in the central and intermediate regions of the disc, and thus, the dynamics follows the items above.
7. The rhythm at which new spiral arms wraps appear with time, and thus new ridges in the $R-V_\\phi$ projection and oscillations of $V_R$ with $L_Z$, depends on the orbital frequencies of the disc through the radial dependence of $\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa$. The number of all these phase-space features and their separation offers a means to infer at the same time the potential (essentially the circular velocity curve parameters) and the starting time and phase of the perturbation. We give analytical formulae for simple power law models that at a theoretical level (in pure phase mixing events) successfully recover the impact times and even disentangle impacts from different successive pericentres.
8. For the MW we find a superposition of two different wavelengths of $> 1100$ and $290-360 \\,km s^{−1}\\,kpc$, similar to the values of Friske & Schönrich (2019) who detected it for the first time.
9. Using typical values of the circular velocity curve of the MW, we obtain times of $< 0.6 \\,Gyr$ and $0.8-2.1\\, Gyr$, associated to these two wavelengths. The first one is slightly smaller than the last Sagittarius pericentre and thus the long wavelength signal could be related to other mechanisms. The range of earlier times is consistent with estimated previous and previous-to-last pericentre of this galactic satellite. These would correspond to four spiral wraps in the range of the data coverage.
10. The validity of this calculation is subject to the assumptions that the impact with Sagittarius was impulsive and distant, and that there is no intervention of other aspects such as self-gravity or the bar, which, on the other hand, has been shown to reproduce several of the observed kinematic features elsewhere as well.
