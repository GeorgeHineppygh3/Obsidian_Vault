### Disclaimers:
Paper is very long and requires more of a deep dive thna abstract and conclusion alone

Paper outlines a good method for looking at the arms in multiple ways

### Un-defined Terms:
- SFE: Star formation efficiency 
- ISRF: Inter stellar radiation field

### Abstract:

- Uses VLA map of the 21cm H transition line
- uses OVRO CO mosaic map
- uses an $H_\\alpha$ image
- Confirms that $H_I$ and $H_{II}$ arms are largely coincident and offset 'downstream' from the CO arms [awaiting response from steven on what downstream exactly means]
- The radial distributions off the surface densities of $H_\\alpha$ and $H_I$  are explained by a 'simple dissociation' picture
- Distributions also demonstrate that the surface density of $H_I$ in molecule rich galaxies is related to the SFE
- The $H_I$ region is wider than the $H_{II}$ - explained by the expected size calculation and also the longer lifetime of the stars producing dissociating radiation and the long timescale of the molecule formation will contribute to the size difference
- There are multiple explanations for the lack of detailed coincidence between the wo $H$ regions

### Conclusion:

- found compelling evidence that $H_I$ is entirely a consequence of dissociation of $H_2$ in star forming regions
- radial distributions of $H_I$ as well as the characteristic size of the emission features along the arms are explained in the disassociation scenario
- The lack of correlation between $H_I$ and $H_{II}$ is not well explained and has multiple possible causes
- $H_I$ in the interarm space could be explained by dissociation from the ISRF or by interarm SF
- indicators that the gas to dust ratio is about equal to the galactic value
- reduced interarm contrast in images compared to the $H_\\alpha$ images indicated that a substantial fraction of the IR emission detected does not arise in star forming regions but from dust generally distributed through the gas.
- It is difficult to interpret FIR emission now as evidence of recent star formation due to the degeneracy issues and thus to infer density wave triggered SF
- The images used are not sufficiently detailed to resolve inside the density wave spiral arms
