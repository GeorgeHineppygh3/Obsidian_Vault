### Abstract:

- studied 1752 spiral galaxies looking for variation in their rotation curves and multi-band optical light profiles and stellar mass profiles
- Parameters tested for diversity:
	- inner slope of rotation curve
	- transition radius
	- average DM fraction
	- rotational velocity
	- total stellar mass
- all quantities measured within PW radius
- two distinct populations identified:
	- blue, low mass spirals with constant $S$
	- redder more massive and more diverse spirals with rapidly increasing $S$ 
- In all cases $S$ seems equally contributed from baryonic and non baryonic DM
- Diversity is shown to increase mildly with mass
- Numerical simulations recreate most baryon dominated galaxy parameters but struggle 
- to match the full diversity of observed galaxy rotation curves (through S) and most dark-matter-dominated parameters
- AGNs are shown to have a significant effect on the shapes of simulated RCs
- inclusion of AGN feedback could align simulation and observation

### Conclusion:

- determined that galaxy inner RC shapes are more strongly correlated with baryon dominated structural parameters than with dark matter dominated parameters
- Two distinct observed galaxy populations were found:
	- low mass galaxies of bluer $(g-z)$ colour with correspondingly low surface brightness (stellar mass density), concentrations and higher dark matter fractions
	- higher mass galaxies of redder $(g-z)$ colour, high surface brightness (stellar mass density), higher concentrations, and lower dark matter fractions
- Bluer galaxies follow: slowly increasing log(S) with increasing stellar mass surface density, while redder galaxies show a steep RC rise matched by a rapid increase in stellar mass surface density
- for both populations:  the diversity (as gauged by the BP slope) is roughly comparable, or mildly increasing, over all mass ranges in the observational data once observational errors are taken into account
- 'The differences between the (intrinsic) observational diversity and the one seen in the simulations is thus most likely due to shortcomings in the simulation’s sub-grid physics'
- NIHAO-AGN simulations predict -  AGN hosts may occasionally disrupt kinematics in higher mass galaxies, and reduce $S$ values - appears to be true
- The addition of SMBH feedback in the NIHAO-AGN simulations also significantly reduces the inner dark matter fraction by ∼20 percent and lowers the maximum velocity by $\\sim85 \\, km s^{-1}$ 
- confirms their significant impact on galaxy RC profiles
- more work is needed to fully characterize the effects of SMBH feedback on gas kinematics in galaxies
- lack of diversity in stellar mass profiles indicates s that the gas matter plays a pivotal role in the variation of $log(S)$ 
- $\\Sigma_{I}^{\\star}$ and $\\Sigma_{I}^{gas}$ show no turning points found in $log(S)$ but $\\Sigma_{I}^{DM}$ do  $\\therefore$  turning points mostly driven by changes in the dark matter fractions of lower mass galaxies
- Future work:  Further establish whether the inability of NIHAO and NIHAOAGN (or any other galaxy simulations) to reproduce the range of RC and light profile shapes at fixed mass is related to: a) the actual backbone of galaxy formation: ΛCDM + hierarchical assembly; and/or b) limitations of sub-grid model baryonic physics
