### Un-defined Terms:
- MW: Milky-Way

### Abstract:
- Map chemical inhomogeneities in the MW disc out to $\\sim 4 \\, kpc$ from the sun using bright giant stars
- Samples were selected using effective temperatures and surface gravities from GSP-Spec to trace stellar populations of various ages
- The cool giants exhibit a smooth metallicity gradient with an azimuthal dependence
- By binning by azimuth the metallicity gradient varies between $0.054\\, dex\\, kpc^{-1}$ at $\\phi =20°$ to  $0.035\\, dex\\, kpc^{-1}$  at $\\phi =20°$
- younger hotter stars present  remarkable inhomogeneities - 3/4 metal-rich elongated features in correspondence of the spiral arms
- when projected to onto the galactic radius the features present themselves as statistically significant bumps on top of the normal metallicity gradients
- Overall the spiral arms leave a strong young star signature which dissipates as older stars are considered

### Conclusion:
- Literature which explains the observed phenomenon - (Khoperskive et al 2018):
	- high res N body simulations showed that kinematically hot and cold stellar populations in the galactic disk react in a different way to spiral arm perturbation naturally leading to azimuthal variations in mean metallicities in stars - young stars have higher metallicity and smaller random motions than older 
	- Found that for three different initial metallicity starting profiles the metallicity inside the spiral arms was consistently higher
