### Un-defined Terms:
- LGTs: Late Type Galaxies

### Abstract:

-  build up of late type galaxies is of key interest to astronomers
- Standard scenario follows two key routes:
	- classical bulges (CBs) assembling first in a quick and violent quasi-monolithic episode followed by gradual disk assembly
	- pseudo-bulge (PB) formation occurring gradually over the gigayear-long secular evolution of LTGs through gentle gas inflow from the disk and in situ star formation at its centre
- looking to investigate the SFH of the LTGs
- 'outline a coherent framework for the formation and evolution of spiral galaxies and their main stellar components'
- spatially resolved SFH using 'population spectral synthesis' from 135 LTGs from CALIFA survey
- analysed SFH through half a million [Spaxels](../Notes/Spaxels.md) 
- the main physical and evolutionary properties of both bulges and disks show a continuous distribution across present-day total stellar mass
- The $e$-folding times vary from centre to edge indicating these systems grow in an inside-out fashion
- the radial gradient of $\\tau$ increases with increasing $M_{\\star ,T}$  for high mass spirals while for low mass roughly the same $\\tau$ across the radial extent
- evolutionary predictions are in line with observations
- bulges and disks of higher mass galaxies exhibit shorter formation timescales as compared to their lower mass counterparts

### Conclusion:

- evidence suggests a unified picture for the formation and evolution of LTGs, in which PBs and CBs denote extremities of a continuous mass sequence
- consistent with the framework where bulges are assembled jointly with their parent disks by gradual inside-out growth, at a pace that is regulated by the depth of the galactic potential
- revealed correlations are entirely devoid of a bimodality, which would be expected if CBs and PBs were to emerge from two distinct formation routes
- ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Very interesting need to see if anyone else can back this up
