### Abstract:

- investigate how the metallicity in both stellar and gaseous components of spiral galaxies of differing masses evolve with time, using data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey
- For stellar component: measure evolution directly by decomposing the galaxy absorption-line spectra into populations of different ages and determining their metallicities
- For gaseous component:   can only measure the present-day metallicity directly from emission lines
- there is a relationship between gas metallicity, stellar mass and star formation rate which does not evolve significantly with redshift
- therefore can use spectral absorption lines to infer redshift and so track variation in gas metallicity over cosmic time
- compared these present day predictions to observed distributions and found it to be a good method
- applied method to 1619 spiral galaxies 
- both stellar mass and metallicity increase together in well mixed low mass systems
- in high mass systems - average stellar metallicity has not increased in step with the inferred gas metallicity, and actually decreases with time
- disjoint in normally expected relationship is most likely due to poor mixing

### Conclusion:

- $MZ_gR$ is generically found to evolve such that: at a given mass, the gas within the galaxies becomes increasingly metal-rich with cosmic time -- in agreement with current literature
- median $MZ_gR$  shows general decline in stellar metallicity from $z \\sim 1.4 \\Rightarrow 0$  and the gradient is the same
- High-mass galaxies have lower average stellar metallicities at later times
- if the gas is not well mixed into the galaxy upon accretion large numbers of metal-poor stars will readily form in that galaxy even at very late times -- This could result in the average stellar metallicities in high mass spiral galaxies being suppressed at the present epoch.
