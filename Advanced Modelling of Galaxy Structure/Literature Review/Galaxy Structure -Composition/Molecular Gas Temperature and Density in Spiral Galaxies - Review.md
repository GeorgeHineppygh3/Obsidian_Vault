### Abstract: 
- used beam matched $^{13}CO$ $J\\,3\\rightarrow2$ and $J\\,2\\rightarrow1$ line data to infer molecular gas excitation in the central ($500<r<1600\\,pc$) region of bright IR galaxies
- Used $J\\,1\\rightarrow0$ lines of $C^{18}O$ to set the opacity of the $^{13}CO$ line average

### Conclusion:  [N/A]
- 


### General:
- Molecular gas density appears to range by over an order of magnitude from galaxy to galaxy
- narrow $^{12}CO$ line indicates that the temperature changes across the galaxies cannot account for the density difference
- Molecular gas temperatures estimated at $T_K = 5-10\\,K$
