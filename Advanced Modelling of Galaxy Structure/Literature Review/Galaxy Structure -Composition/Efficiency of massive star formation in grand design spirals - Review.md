### Un-defined Terms:

- SFE: Star formation efficiency

### Abstract:

- Study estimates the efficiency ratio for massive star formation between arms and inter arm space for three grand design spirals
- Estimate is based on the $H_\\alpha$ and $H_{II}$ regions of the galaxies.
- Find that efficiency ratio is $>10$ in zones between the Lindblad resonances and the co-rotation radius
- ratio drops to unity at the three resonance radii
- These results indicate an influence of resonance structure in stimulating star formation.

### Conclusion:

- All three well-defined spirals present high arm/inter-arm SFE ratios consistent with spiral density wave theory
- Method outlines an estimate of the co-rotation radius (hence pattern speed) and subsequently estimates the scale of the star forming regions.
- Conclusively can say that the observations could not be easily explained by self-stochastic propagation of star formation - [IE its density wave triggered]
