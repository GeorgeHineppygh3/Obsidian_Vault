### Abstract:
- In general spiral arms rotate at a different pattern speed to the bar
- bar rotates faster than the spiral (current literature) 2-3X faster rotational velocity
- [Manifold theory (needs further research!!!!)](../Notes/Manifold%20theory%20(needs%20further%20research!!!!).md) covers barred spirals with two pattern speeds
- 'where the orbits that support the spiral density wave are chaotic, and are related to the manifolds emanating from the Lagrangian points $L_1$ and $L_2$ at the end of the bar'
- study considers an alternative scenario where the bar rotates much faster compared to the spiral arms to be considered a perturbation of the spiral potential
- In this case the stable elliptical orbits that  support the spiral density wave are transformed into quasi-periodic orbits with a certain thickness
- The superposition of these perturbed ellipses for all energy levels of the Hamiltonian creates a slightly perturbed symmetrical spiral wave [very interesting - perhaps a move against the manifold theory under these conditions]

### Conclusion:
- construct a normal form Hamiltonian in first and second order approximations eliminating the time dependence due to the difference between pattern speeds
- Demonstrate that in a fast rotating bar the spiral structure can arise from the deforming and precession of thick ellipses.
- By reducing the bar mass we find less intense spiral structure
- reducing bar pattern speed find less intense spiral density waves and breaks in the waves
- wave breaks also occur in extremely fast rotating bar scenarios
- lower limit of the bar mass set at $10^{10}M_\\odot$ 
- The scenario breaks down at $\\Omega_b = \\Omega_{sp}$ where the bar can no longer be considered a perturbation to the spiral and the manifold theory prevails
