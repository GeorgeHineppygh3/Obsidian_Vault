### Abstract:

- Sample of 279 Galaxies chosen by Guo et. al 2020 166 of which observed by ALFALFA
- observe $H_I$ content of 113 massive red spirals
- S/N $> 4.7$
- Compared to FAST the galaxies have higher S/N and 'reach to lower $H_I$ mass'
- Used DESI survey to compare colour profiles of red spirals to examine $H_I$ content
- Galaxies with $H_I$ have bluer edges in both ALFALFA and FAST
- there is a clear correlation between galaxy $H_I$ mass and g-r colour excess at the outer radius
- Higher $H_I$ mass have bluer outer discs
- results indicate that red spirals are not fully quenched and that the $H_I$ gas observed may be in the outer blue disc


### Conclusion:

- FAST has lower rms noise and S/N
- These red spirals may not be entirely red edge to edge
- results suggest the failure of the global optical colour to identify truly passive galaxies, and a close association between the cold gas content and the outer disc of galaxies
- Cortese 2012 said 'that at high stellar masses, optical colours are not sufficient to distinguish between star forming and quiescent galaxies'
- optically selected red spirals lie on the UV-optical blue sequence - Star forming systems
- optically selected red spirals are mostly green/blue in NUV-r - indicating on-going star formation in these galaxies
- optically selected red spirals have on average young stellar populations in the outer region -  (consistent with the blue outer edge theory)
- Cook et. al 2019 found 'little dependence of the presence of a photometric bulge on the global HI gas content of local galaxies'
- Namiki et. al 2020 showed 'at fixed stellar mass and SFR, the presence of small-scale structures in galaxy images is linked to the total HI gas content of galaxies'
- Wang et. al 2011 revealed 'galaxies with higher HI fractions have bluer outer discs with more star-formation'
- results also indicate that cold gas content is more related to the spatially resolved properties such as properties of disk component than the global properties of galaxies
- Still require the identification of a direct connection between $H_I$ mass and star formation in the blue region of the disc - Relationship has been found in early type galaxies by Yidiz et. al 2017
- Lemonias et. al 2011 have shown that $4-30\\%$ of galaxies could have an XUV disc
- 'Galaxies with an XUV-disk are nearly twice as gas-rich as their non-XUV-disk counterparts with a similar morphological type'  - Thicker et. al 2007
- findings imply that a centrally quenched galaxy, given a large neutral gas reservoir, could also have recent star formation activities in the outskirt and thus a bluer outer disc
- They reckon that a large fraction of teh chosen red spirals could have XUV discs
