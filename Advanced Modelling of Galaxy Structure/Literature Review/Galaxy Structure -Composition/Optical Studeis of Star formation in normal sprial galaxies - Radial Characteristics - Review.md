### Abstract:

- used elliptical aperture photometry  to calculate the de-projected surface brightness as a function of radius to trace the SFH and SFR 
- studied mainly barred spirals
- nearly all barred spirals showed ongoing SFR in the bulge, most likely fed from in-falling gas along the bar
- the disc $H_\\alpha$ profiles are quite shallow compared with the broadband exponential discs - implying relative insensitivity of the SFR on the surface density of already formed stars
- in both the bulge and disc the gas inflow is on the same timescale as the replenishment

### Conclusion:

1. Even with the high extinction and possible non thermal contributions excess $H_\\alpha$ emission was found in the nuclei of nearly all barred spirals, suggesting ongoing massive star formation - fits with model of gas in-fall from passage along the bars

2. Disc $H_\\alpha$ profiles are much shallower than the exponential disc - the SFR is only weakly affected by the local star density - this makes sense as local stars would deplete the available gas supply unless it could be replenished by radial inflow or continual in-fall of gas onto the disc
