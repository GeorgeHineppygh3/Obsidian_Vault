### Un-defined Terms:
- SNe: Super Nova event
- WIM: Warm Ionised Medium
- MW: Milky-Way

### Introduction: 
- WIM is detected by:
	- Dispersion of pulsar signals
	- Faint optical line emission due to recombination ($H_\\alpha$) and collisional excitation of metastable lines ($[S II] \\;and\\; [NII]$)
- Ionising photon power required greater than SNe
- As a results WIM assumed to be warmed by young stars [Find a paper on the topology of the ISM]
- Vertical structure of WIM Is important
- pulsar observations show it to be 3kpc thick with a filling factor between 10% and 30%
- Wim has been observed to extend beyond $|z|>3\\,kpc$ (UV absorption studies towards hot halo stars)
- vertical structure knowledge is the precursor to understanding the ionising pressure and other things can be addressed


### Conclusion:
- Successfully detected the WIM in NGC 891
- radial distribution of WIM follows the molecular or young star distribution
- WIM in NGC891 > MW
- WIM thickness found to be $\\sim 9\\,Kpc$ (3x MW)
- presence of low ionisation gas at large radii where young stars are uncommon gives clues towards halo origin?
- Ionised gas at large radio implies UV photons are escaping the disc or that extragalactic UV background plays an important role
- The bulk of the WIM is from SF - therefore assuming high SFR in NGC981
- Only SNe can get gas to the large $z$-heights
- Support of this comes from the presence of 'worms' - kilo-parsec long vertical filaments from left overs of super-shells
- Also saw 600pc long super shell fragment located 1 kpc above the galactic plane
