### Disclaimers:

- model does not account for the bulge and so the central region predictions are questionable - sus

### Abstract:

- Present application of 'multiphase model' developed for solar neighbourhoods and generalised to other regions of the disc
- Model employs two zone system (Halo and disc) sliced into nine cylindrical concentric regions
- model looks at time evolution of the regions
- Regions model regions found within MW environment:
	- diffuse gas
	- molecular clouds
	- low and high mass stars
	- stellar remnants
- Aim to reproduce metallicity gradients in MW and other galaxies
- Analyse time evolution of the gradients to relate to SFR and in-fall rate
- Observational constraints of the model:
	- abundance gradients
	- age-metallicity relations for halo and disc
	- gas mass distributions (includes radial differences for molecular and atomic) - [could be interesting to come back to?]
	- radial distribution of SFH
- Time evolution of abundance gradients reveals flattening with time
- Oxygen abundance gradient steeper at early times due to larger in-fall
- disc evolution demonstrates saturation points in each ring region [could this be an explanation for ring structures in large spirals - perhaps there might be something in the ring position in terms of half light radius and oxygen content from in-fall]


### Conclusion:

1. By varying the SFR in concentric regions abundances and gas densities can be calculated from knowing:
	- increased gas density in central regions
	- high gas replenishment rate in central regions
- SFR variation is constrained by the initial abundance gradients and so galactic age

2. For $\\tau_{present} \\sim 13 \\,Gyr$ $\\tau_{collapse}$ is constrained to $\\sim 1-2\\,Gyr$ by element abundance and SFR gradients
- The produced AMR and SFR are in good agreement with observation with $\\tau_{collapse}$ constrained in this way
- younger disc ages could correspond to slower collapses


3.  if in-fall rate parameter $f(r)$ has a short length scale              ($f(r)=f_0 e^{-r/R_0}$) gradients are presented only if SF is a slow process.
- The difference between the in-fall scale length and the mass scale length produces the radial distribution of SFR. For reproduction of gradients the two scale lengths must be similar

4. Abundance gradients invariably flatten with time; galactic system evolves towards saturation, slopes can be different according to the evolutionary stage of the ring

5. The SFR in central regions decreases 'appreciably' with time, internal regions more blue in the past

6. The SFR does not depend on the total gas in a simple way in order to reproduce both atomic and molecular radial gas distributions 

7.  The AMR for both the solar region and outer regions are in good agreement with observations, systematic lower slope for external regions noticed - Result of slower SF activity and different accretion from low-metal material coming from galactic halo

8. More massive galaxies (volumetric mass density) have higher SFR in the past and then enrich more efficiently producing flatter gradients with evolution.
