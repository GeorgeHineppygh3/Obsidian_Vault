### Abstract:
- 'Shocks and torques produced by non-axisymmetric structures such as spiral arms and bars may transport gas to galaxy central regions'
- studied the dependence of the concentration of CO luminosity, molecular gas and the star formation rate in the central region ($R<2\\, kpc$)  on the strength of non-axisymmetric disk structure
- studied a sample of 57 galaxies selected from EDGE-CALIFA survey
- the molecular gas concentration is calculated using a $CO$-to-$H_2$ conversion factor that decreases with higher metallicity and higher surface density.
- find that molecular concentration is systematically lower than the $CO$ luminosity by $0.22\\,dex$ 
- confirm that increased molecular concentration and stronger non-axisymmetrical structure is more common in barred galaxies 
- suggests that the stronger the bars and spirals the more efficient the galaxy is in transporting cold gas to its centre
- the active galaxy molecular concentration appear no different to the inactive galaxies of similar structure - implying the galactic nucleus may have less of an effect on the molecular gas distribution
- find that the SFR tightly correlates with the molecular gas concentration in both barred and un-barred galaxies.
- find elevated SFR in galaxies with stronger disk structure [concentration thing again]
- conclude that higher inflow rate result from stronger structure

### Conclusion:

- AGN feedback does not affect molecular gas concentration at all possibly
- stronger structure $\\rightarrow$ stronger SFR
- arms and bars transport gas to the centres but have no apparent effect on raising the central SFE
- bars and arms create the bulge through transport i.e. drive evolution to spherical randomly virialized galaxies
