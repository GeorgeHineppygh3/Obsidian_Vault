### Abstract:
- density wave based on the [Lin-Shu dispersion relation](../Notes/Lin-Shu%20dispersion%20relation.md) 
- Under assumption the density waves move with the group velocity towards the inner Lindblad resonance and disappear 
- Various replacement mechanisms have been proposed
- Non-linear effects play important roles at the co-rotation radii and Lindblad resonances
- the ellipses that support the spiral pattern process and extend to the 4:1 resonance
- In barred galaxies the spiral arms extend along the manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits. At the end of the bar orbits are chaotic 
- Orbits at $L_1$ and $L_2$ can be found analytically

### Conclusion:
- There are two types of density waves in spirals
	- Precessing ellipses in normal galaxies - inside corotation composed of ordered orbits
	- Manifold Spirals in barred galaxies - outside corotation composed of chaotic orbits
- Therefore the density wave theory argued against by [Galaxy Zoo and SPARCFIRE - constraints on spiral arm formation mechanisms from spiral arm number and pitch angles - Review](Galaxy%20Zoo%20and%20SPARCFIRE%20-%20constraints%20on%20spiral%20arm%20formation%20mechanisms%20from%20spiral%20arm%20number%20and%20pitch%20angles%20-%20Review.md) still holds
