### Abstract:
- angular momentum distribution in [Cepheids](../Notes/Cepheids.md) in the MW is bi-modal with a gap at $L_{gap} = 2950 \\, km\\,s^{-1}$, corresponding to $R=13\\,kpc$. Where no bi-modality is seen in other star types in general disc population.
- Demonstrated that SF in multiple spiral arm segments at the same [Azimuth](../Notes/Azimuth.md) leads to the multi modality which dissolves showing only in young stars
- unlike being in 1:1 orbital resonance with the galactic bar the multi modality accounts for the observed steepening of the [Stellar warp](../Notes/Stellar%20warp.md) at $L_{gap}$ 
- Gap is only clear in young stars where purely stellar dynamical origins would affect all disc populations including old

### Conclusion:
- Used IllustrisTNG simulation t simulate a galaxy with extended spiral structure -traced by both gas and correspondingly aged stars
- The distribution of the stars:
	- angular momentum
	- tangential velocity
	- radius
- follow distributions similar to the MW
- over all the distributions over L is multi-modal in all quadrants with at least one with a clear gap - gap caused by spatial gap between their birth places in two spiral arms at the same azimuth
- Formation mechanism for spiral structure still unknown however flybys of two $\\sim 10^8\\,M_\\odot$ objects within $\\sim 20\\, kpc$ are likely to have played a role
- For the same mechanism to be the origin of the gap found in the MW the two spiral arms at $R=13\\,kpc$ must have formed stars 100-200 Myr ago. 
- MW ISM tracing is hard but Sgr dwarf galaxy could have triggered or enhanced the spiral structure of the outer disc leading to the spiral arms forming at the same azimuth
- The explanation means that the gap is present in young stars s their current position most accurately reflects their birth place - whereas older stars phase mixing and perturbations remove any coherence from a common origin
- The age at which this feature disappears is hard to predict - assumed from sim that its $1 \\,Gyr$
- the absence of coherence in general population outlaws the dynamical origin of orbital resonances with the galactic bar which affects all stars depending on their $\\sigma$ 
- gap may coincide with discontinuity properties of the warp as two spirals in a warped disc will have distinct orbital planes
- This is true for sim and MW
