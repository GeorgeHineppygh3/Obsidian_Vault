### Abstract:
- Used 
	- MUSE: $H_\\alpha$ 
	- ATLMA: $CO$
	- JWST-MIRI: $21\\mu m$ 
- Examined star formation in NGC 628 - large face on grand design spiral
- Focussed on northern spiral arm at $R = 3-4\\,kpc$ studying two spurs from the arm
- one spur is $CO$ rich the other $CO$ poor and have maximum azimuthal offsets 40° MUSE and 55°
- SFR is higher in the spurs near the arms however SFE is relatively constant [this is good as it supports the bunching of gas for acceleration inside the density wave]
- Given the pattern speed at rotation curve it is assumed all material leaving the pattern travels in a purely circular motion
- the produced offsets would be formed in $100-150\\,Myr$ significantly longer than the $21\\mu m$ and $H_\\alpha$ timescales ($<10Myr$)
- invariance of SFE provides very string evidence that SF is triggered in spiral arms and cannot simply occur in the arm and drift away from the wave pattern.
- Early JWST data suggests that SF likely occurs in the spurs and that observed young stars are not leftovers of stellar birth inside the arm

### Conclusion:
- NGC628 Spiral arm spurs where chosen due to their close proximity but different ISM composition ($CO$ rich $CO$ poor)
- offsets of spurs indicate drifting due to difference in circular rotation speed and pattern speed assume difference is of order timescale $100\\,Myr$ 
- Work shows only the beginning of JWST's ability to probe individual ISM environments to learn the evolution of the ISM during star formation
