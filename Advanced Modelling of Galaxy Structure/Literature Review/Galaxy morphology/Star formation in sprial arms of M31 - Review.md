### Disclaimers:
paper is very short - may have only the first page but not sure - Harvard file format is so dumb honestly

## Relations:
- Paper: [Paper Review Template](Paper%20Review%20Template.md) 

### Un-defined Terms:
- 


### General:
- Seeks to answer the same questions as [Density wave triggered star formation in grand design spirals - Review](./Density%20wave%20triggered%20star%20formation%20in%20grand%20design%20spirals%20-%20Review.md) 
- Dual Elmgreens (1986) investigated global parameters which characterize SFR and SFE in Hubble spirals
- average star formation per unit area is the same in fractured and non fractured arms - where both indicate increased SFE from density wave propagation
- Paper ends?
