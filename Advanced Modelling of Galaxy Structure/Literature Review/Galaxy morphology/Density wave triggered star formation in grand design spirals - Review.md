### Disclaimers:
Very old paper and also very short seems theoretical with lack of computational accompaniment

## Relations:
- Paper: [Density wave triggered star formation in grand design spirals - Review](Density%20wave%20triggered%20star%20formation%20in%20grand%20design%20spirals%20-%20Review.md)

### Un-defined Terms:
- RSFE relative star formation efficiency 

### General:

- spiral arms are the normal site for SF -  hence can see them in the disc
- spiral structure is observed as higher concentration (compared to inter-arm region of disc) of:
	- $H_{II}$ 
	- neutral gas
	- dust
	- stars
- General acceptance of spiral arms representing density waves in the disc is still unclear as some remaining questions:
	- is the higher SF in the spiral arms triggered by the passage of the density wave or simply due to increased gas column density?
- Ratio of star formation efficiency in the arms divided by that of the interarm region at the same radius [how was this decided?] named the 'relative massive star formation efficiency' 
- efficiency determined as the ratio of the mass of the stars (calculated from the $H_\\alpha$ flux) to the mass of the neutral gas (atomic and molecular) 
- if the relative efficiency is of 'order unity' the star formation is proportional to the mass of the gas, if some kind of induced star formation has occurred the relative efficiency should be considerably larger than unity
- Studied five spirals and showed there elative efficiencies to be much larger than unity where all arms of a given galaxy show a geometrically congruent pattern of peaks and dips
- the regions of RSFE confined between the inner and outer Linblad resonances (IE single density wave)
- This demonstrates model is in good agreement that star formation is being triggered by the passage of the density wave
- current other models explaining arms cannot account for this and reproduce the wave
- One galaxy with peaks and dips did not show this (M33) indicating Sf is not induced by a resonant system
