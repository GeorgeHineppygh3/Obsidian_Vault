UDG - Ultra Diffuse Galaxies
UCD - Ultra Compact Galaxies

conclusions:

1. the six clusters observed between 200-1400
2. this is consistent with abundance halo relations
3. slope of relation is weakly non linear  and suggests UDGs are more easily destroyed in low mass halos or UDGs are created in clusters
4. not uniformly distributed
5. only in the most relaxed clusters distributed uniformly
6. location of UDGs and UCDs anticorrelated
7. 3x more abundant in higher mass systems
8. tidal disruption probably produces UCDs
9. the destruction of UDGs
