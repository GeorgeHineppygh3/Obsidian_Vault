The catalogues include multi-band photometry (8 HST bands, deep Ks from the [HAWK-I FF program](http://gbrammer.github.io/HAWKI-FF/), and Spitzer-IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 um), magnification, photometric redshifts and rest-frame properties, plus a variety of diagnostic information. The cluster pointings have been analysed following a multi-step procedure to remove foreground emission from intra-cluster light and very bright galaxies. Photometry from low-resolution IR bands has been derived with [T-PHOT](http://www.astrodeep.eu/t-phot/ "New software release: T-PHOT").
