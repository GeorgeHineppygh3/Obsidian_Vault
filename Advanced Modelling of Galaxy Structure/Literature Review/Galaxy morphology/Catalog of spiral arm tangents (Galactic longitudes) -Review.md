### Abstract:
- Updated catalogue of observed tangents to spiral arms of MW presented
- the separation of each arm tracer from the dust lane is measured to obtain the relative speed away from the dust lane (age gradient).
- Age gradient across the spiral arm: $11.3\\pm 2 \\,Myr \\,kpc^{-1}$ 
- Relative sped away from the dust lane: $87 \\pm 10 km\\,s^{-1}$
