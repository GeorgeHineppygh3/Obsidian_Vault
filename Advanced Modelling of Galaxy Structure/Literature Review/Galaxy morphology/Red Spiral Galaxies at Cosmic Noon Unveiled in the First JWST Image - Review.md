### Abstract:

- JWST imaged MACS J0723.3-7327 and identified a large fraction of red spirals
- this was surprising because they are not very common in local among nearby spirals
- galaxies have been previously observed with *Spitzer* space telescope at $3-4 \\,\\mu m$  but couldn't provide enough detail to recognise their spiral structure
- focussed on the reddest spirals which are very faint in $<0.9\\, \\mu m$ and show red colours in $2-4\\,\\mu m$ bands
- Study finds two extremely red spirals at $1<z<3$ 
- one is likely a passive galaxy with moderate dust reddening
- The other could either be passive or dusty starburst
- interesting new morphology of galaxies that can now only be observed with JWST due to its unprecedented spatial resolution

### Conclusion:

- studied RS13 and RS14
- By performing SED fitting have found:
	- RS14 has $z_{spec} = 2.463$
	- SED fit suggests extremely red spiral galaxies are passive galaxies or heavily dust-obscured galaxies
	- properties are indicated from the red colors of the rest-frame wavelength of $\\sim 430 âˆ’ 1280\\,nm$ photometry
	- RS14 is found to be passive spiral galaxy
	- finding passive galaxies at high redshifts/early times is not common
- Further study:  understand the formation mechanisms and evolutionary path of the red spiral galaxies using integral field spectroscopy, including high-resolution ALMA observations, will provide kinematics, molecular gas, and dust distribution of high-redshift spiral galaxies.
