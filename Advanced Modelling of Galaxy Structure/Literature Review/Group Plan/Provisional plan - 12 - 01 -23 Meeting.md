Plan no longer than two pages

-   Scope and objectives: How well does the plan convey the nature and extent of the research problem? Does it clearly set out the objectives and motivation?
-   Methodology and organisation: Does the division into work packages provide a good framework for carrying out the project? How well have time and other resources been allocated to them? Have relevant safety issues been considered?

Things to do:

- produce general plan structure
- Need to produce a Gant chart
- Division of work
- Update diary before Friday (conclusively) 3%


Aims and objectives:

- extract arms from images and measure light contribution from the arms vs disc


Safety:

- boring stuff like don't hurt your back 
- don't strain your eyes


Plan:

- Begin with testing [potentially with spirality]
- then test with some face on spirals from galaxy zoo (SDSS - GZ2)
- Galaxy DECALS - overlaps with SDSS
- then widen testing to all 
- Colour analysis of the luminosity of the arms based in the disc


## Stevens advice:

- couple of sentences summarising the project

The project outlines the use to of the JAX adapted GALFITM code; GAX, to use non-parametric fitting to: identify unusual galaxies, determine relationships between features and characterising morphological features. The project will focus on determining relationships between features by using the fitting process to extract the spiral arms of galaxies to measure the luminosity/colour contributions to the overall photometric profiles. 


- work packages - divide work into sections (often two levels - broad objectives - sub objectives)

- Generate spiral galaxies from Gen Spiral
	- obtain MATLAB code
	- run MATLAB code
	- create sample set of easily extractable galaxies
- Download and select test candidates from GZ dataset
	- Download dataset
	- extract images and prepare format for analysis
- Confirm extraction + apply preliminary analysis
	- prepare sample extracted images
	- apply luminosity + colour analysis to sample extracted images
- Apply extraction to GZ Decals dataset
	- prepare dataset for extraction
	- Run extraction over dataset
	- process resulting extractions
- Analyse extracted data
	- analyse luminosity contribution to total flux from spiral arms
	- colour analysis in terms of difference to disc components
- Plot and Tabulate data
	- create appropriate plots for demonstrating observed data trends/relationships
	- create appropriate tables for data sources 





- briefly explain each work package and each sub task
- fit that into a timeline which feeds into the gant chart
- starting now
	- key moments (full time work date + holidays)
	- work back from hand in date (2 weeks of writing)
	- start writing early
	- Example: when finish work package on generating spirals write paragraph on GenSpiral
- ending due date
- better do less things better and correct
