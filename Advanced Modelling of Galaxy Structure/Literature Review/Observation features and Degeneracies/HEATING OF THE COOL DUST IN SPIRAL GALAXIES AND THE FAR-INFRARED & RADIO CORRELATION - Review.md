- Paper: ![Heating of the Cool Dust in Spiral Galaxies and the Far-Infrared-Radio Correlation - C. Xu.47X](../../../PDFs/Heating%20of%20the%20Cool%20Dust%20in%20Spiral%20Galaxies%20and%20the%20Far-Infrared-Radio%20Correlation%20-%20C.%20Xu.47X.md)
### Un-defined Terms:
- RC: Radio Continuum
- IRF: Interstellar radiation field


### Abstract: 
- correlation between the FIR and radio continuum  has been hard to explain because they are thought to pertain to different star formation time scales: FIR $\\sim 10^9 \\, yr$, RC  $\\sim 10^8 \\, yr$
- Studied the contribution to the FIRT emission from heating by non ionising UV radiation ($912-300\\, \\mathring{A}$)
- Studied 39 'normal' spirals
- contribution to the UV heating and cool FIR luminosity can on average account for 76% of the FIR radiation in the range $40-120\\,\\mu m$ 
- There is a strong (0.85) linear correlation between the integrated FIR luminosity and the contribution from UV heated dust grains
- Conclude that the dominant mode of dust heating in spiral discs is through non ionising UV from the IRF 
- Since UV radiation in the  ($912-300\\, \\mathring{A}$) is mainly released from stars in the mas range $5-20\\, M_\\odot$ ([Supernova Progenitors](../Notes/Supernova%20Progenitors.md))
- Assumptions hold on the assumption that cosmic-ray particles are predominantly accelerated by supernovae and their remnants

### Conclusion:  
- Using the SN progenitor conclusion the SFH timescale when probed by FIR emission is on the same timescale as a $5\\,M_\\odot$ lifetime $\\sim 10^7 \\, yr$ 
- This reduces the assumed FIR timescale from $10^8-10^9$  to $10^7$
- heating of dust is due to stars which give the dominant contribution to the blue emission has been shown that late B type and A type stars are responsible for the heating as they are mostly non-ionising.
- Other work comes to the same conclusion
