### Disclaimers:
Paper from 1991 but has Kennicutt on it so must be good

## Relations:
- Paper: ![Multifrequency Windows on Spiral Galaxies. I. UBV and H-alpha Aperture Photometry - G. Gavazzi & R. Kennicutt.1207G](../../../PDFs/Multifrequency%20Windows%20on%20Spiral%20Galaxies.%20I.%20UBV%20and%20H-alpha%20Aperture%20Photometry%20-%20G.%20Gavazzi%20&%20R.%20Kennicutt.1207G.md)

### Un-defined Terms:
- FIR: far infra-red

### Abstract:

- nonthermal radio continuum activity in spiral galaxies is found to be proportional to the SFR - but at any SFR the radio continuum is stronger in clusters than isolated environments


### Conclusion:

1. The radio continuum activity (per unit visible light) in spiral galaxies is generally proportional to their massive SFR
2. The tightest correlation between radio continuum and $H_\\alpha$ flux is found when quantities are normalised by the H band flux rather than the V band flux [this could be useful when doing image operations so remember]
3. Correlation between radio continuum emissivity and the SFR is tighter and steeper in the cluster environments 
4. the FIR emissivity is also related to the SFR - data indicates that the young high mass stars are responsible for the dust heating in galaxies with hot FIR colours - but still contribution from older lower mass stars cannot be neglected
5. no differences found in the FIR properties and colours in or out of clusters
6. The clusters are indistinguishable from the external clusters in terms of their SFR frequencies alone
7. The radio continuum FIR ratio is significantly larger in clusters than out
