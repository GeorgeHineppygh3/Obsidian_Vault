### Un-defined Terms:
- SFR: Star Formation Rate
- SFE: Star Formation Efficiency
- ISM: Inter-Stellar Medium
- MW: Milky-Way


### Abstract: 
- Derive SFR and SFE in arm and inter-arm regions of M51 from observation of molecular and ionised gas in the ISM
- Showed that $H_I$ observations are consistent with the dissociation of molecular gas by young massive stars
- Young stars cannot dissociate or ionise all of the gas
- 60% of gas remains molecular
- the SFE in M51 is similar to MW and does not appear enhanced in arms [what??]
- Concludes the affect of a string density wave me be to concentrate the molecular gas and hence young stars [what???]
