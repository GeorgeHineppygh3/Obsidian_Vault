#### Prose Structure:

-  Lindblad expanded the density wave theory by demonstrating that epicycles of galactic orbiting gravitating bodies would enter resonance with the spiral pattern frequency at three distinct radii: co-rotation (pattern frequency =  frequency), inner Lindblad resonance () and outer Lindblad resonance. 
- Lin & Shu proposed the idea of spiral arms being composed of areas of greater density in which stars encounter a 'traffic jam'.
- Lin and Shu provided a plausible basis that spiral structure can arise out of gravitational instability finding an explicit asymptotic formula for the form of the spiral.
- Subsequently in [Binney and Tremaines book] it was shown that spiral waves can grow between the inner and outer resonance radii
- The density waves have been shown to extend to the 4:1 resonance
- The density waves at the resonance points are governed by non linear affects which are explained by the invariant manifolds of unstable chaotic periodic orbits which form two families which each  terminate at the LaGrange points $L_1$ and $L_2$ situated, in barred spirals, at the ends of the bar. 
- Manifold theory has demonstrated that the position of the apocenters of the unstable periodic orbits remain correlated for significant time - enough to support density waves outside of co-rotation.
- Subsequent work has shown that Lin, Shu and Lindblad's resonance and precessing ellipses are responsible for the spiral structure before co-rotation and the invariant manifold explanation explains the continuation of the structure out to larger radii.
- Multiple pattern speeds for different morphological structures proves to be the key origin of spiral structure.
- It has been demonstrated through manifold theory that when setting the pattern speed of the bar significantly greater than the arms, treating the arms as a perturbing potential, modified spiral arm structure emerges.
- In this case the stable periodic orbits inside co-rotation are transformed to thick qausi-periodic orbits. The superposition of these orbits creates a slightly perturbed spiral structure.
- For barred spirals the bar acts as a transport mechanism to the centre of the galaxy.
- Since the unstable orbits terminate at the ends of the bar defined by the first two LaGrange points, the bar acts to recycle material at larger radii to fuel the development of galactic bulges.

- Studies of galaxy morphology from GZ have demonstrated that the presence of bars influences spiral structure with barred spirals demonstrating $4^\\circ-6^\\circ$ less tightly wound arms.
- bulge mass concentration not the dominant cause of pitch angle implying not all spiral arms are governed by classical density waves.
- The lack of conclusive understanding of the relationship between morphological features and the affects on spiral structure leaves [NEED TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS MIGHT NOT BE IN AS MUCH DISAGREEMENT AS IT APPEARS AS MANIFOLDS ARE NOT CLASSICAL DENSITY WAVES]

- Spiral structure described so far in terms of internal interactions but external galaxy galaxy interactions are also responsible for accelerating or influencing the structure.
- Distant tidal interactions have been shown to perturb spiral structure and concentrate specifically two armed spiral densities.

#### Prose Structure:

- The over density of stellar fuel results in increased star formation and hence a large population of young stars
- The molecular and atomic gas over-densities are enriched the stellar population in the arms resulting in positive metallicity gradients towards spiral arms
- the chemical enrichment from heavier elements demonstrates range of stellar populations which is confirmed by the younger hotter stars representing larger inhomogeneities in the spiral arms
-  as a consequence of the density waves concentrating the gas/fuel the dense metal rich arms provide the perfect environment for star formation

#### Prose Structure:

- The passage of the dense star forming environment sweeping through the galactic disc induces and accelerates star formation 
- The Lindblad resonances demonstrate affects on the rate of star formation [expand]
- The counter explanation of self-stochastic star formation cannot explain the SFE indicator of the $H_I$ to $H_{II}$ distributions returning to unity at the three resonance radii
- The ratios of SFE are consistent between arm and inter arm regions but with dramatically increased SFR indicating the density wave is inducing the star formation

- The transient nature of the star forming region evolves over time with metallicity gradients plateauing after progressive enrichment. 
- Modelling a cylindrically binned two zone halo and disc  saturation times are estimated to be on the timescale of galaxy evolution demonstrating the arms to be a key factor for evolution.
- Progressive enrichment of galaxies has been agreed within the literature for a while.
- the metallicity enrichment is demonstrated to affect higher mass galaxies less where the saturation point requires overall more material to reach the critical concentration and/or there is better gas recycling to prevent stellar suffocation

- The radio continuum and FIR correlation leads to the correlation between SFR and radio continuum from heating of dust grains
- The grain heating has to be non ionising and so 76% of the FIR luminosity can be assumed to have come from non ionising light from young stars emitting in the range $912-300\\, \\mathring{A}$ constraining their masses to $5-20\\, M_\\odot$ i.e. supernovae progenitors
- conversely the heating contributions from older stellar populations cannot be ignored and induce uncertainty in the measurement of SFR
[- Multiple conclusions indicate the presence of $H_I$ is entirely from  dissociation of $H_{II}$ ]
- the lack of arm/inter-arm contrast in $H_\\alpha$ images indicates a substantial fraction of the IR emission has not arisen from heating in star forming regions



- The cultivated/enhanced stellar population demonstrates angular momentum bi modality in young stars where purely stellar dynamical origins would affect all disc populations
- The angular momentum gap is explained by the position of the young stars largely representing their birth place where older stars coherence from their origin is removed by phase mixing and perturbations
- This transient feature demonstrates a relationship between stellar age and position in the spiral arm
- age gradients across spiral arms have been investigated by the velocities of stars moving away from the centre of the density wave and the momentum gap is supported by the produced gradients
- by constraining the ages and masses of stars within the star forming regions of the wave to supernovae progenitors the [I WANT TO SAY IF THE STARS IN THE ARM HAVE TO BE YOUNGER THAN SUPERNOVAE THEN THE THERE SHOULD BE A RELATIONSHIP TO SNE AND THE ARMS]
- found that the light decline curve in 1a SNe is correlated to the distance to spiral arms before and after corotation
- SNe are found at the inner and outer shock fronts and hence represent the final stage of the progenitor evolution [obviously some stars make it out and we just see the SNe so this isn't the end of the stars life but a fork in the road]

#### Prose Structure:

- Gax traces it's origin to GALFIT where two dimensional: Sérsic, Moffat and Nuker profiles were fitted to single band images of galaxies using the programming language $C$. The original program minimised the Chi squared between the model and the observed flux.
- The second evolution GALFITM modifies the original GALFIT code to incorporate multiple bands
- GALFIT M weights bands based on the highest S/N 
- GALFIT M structural parameters at different wavelengths modelled via Chebyshev polynomials (allows for flexibility)
- The final form of GAX takes advantage of vectorise computing primarily intended for machine learning (JAX) to execute fitting on graphics cards with many parallelised calculations to reduce run time.

- using the progressive disc fitting model within GAX the areas which do not fit the model are extracted as part of the non parametric fitting extraction 
- Begin first running the code on face on spirals from filtered GZ dataset
-

## Conclusion: [100 Words]

- Spiral arms acting as sweeping star factories in the disc of spiral galaxies
- understanding the contribution/ratio between the colour and luminosities in the arm/interarm region will be important to reveal if SFR is slowing in the disc at the same rate as in the arm
- By using non parametric fitting expanded from GALFITM into GAX the model based exclusion of the arms and disc will reduce the uncertainty in spiral arm extraction and allow for measurement of the luminosity ratio's between disc and arms in multiple bands to explore the relationship at progressive wavelengths
