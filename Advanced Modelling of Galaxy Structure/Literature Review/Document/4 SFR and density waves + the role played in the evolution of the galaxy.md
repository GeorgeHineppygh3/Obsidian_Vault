The passage of the dense star forming environment sweeping through the galactic disc induces and accelerates star formation \\cite{cepa1993density}.  By measuring the ratio of the star forming efficiencies in arm and inter-arm regions the relative star forming efficiency (RSFE) can be obtained. The RSFE in spiral galaxies is shown to be significantly large for all regions except at the three resonance radii where it returns to unity, \\cite{cepa1990efficiency} indicating resonance has an affect on stimulating star formation. The counter explanation; self-stochastic star formation, cannot explain the RSFE indicator at the resonance radii reaching unity \\cite{cepa1990efficiency}. More recent work on spiral arm spurs at significantly higher spatial resolution found little change in SFE across the spur but significantly increased SFR \\cite{williams2022phangs}. This evidence supports the density wave driving star formation as the star SFR is proportional to the density but the SFE is not. 

The transient nature of the star forming region evolves over time with metallicity gradients plateauing after progressive enrichment \\cite{ferrini1994evolution}.  By computing a cylindrically binned two zone (halo-disc) model, saturation times inside spiral arms are estimated to be on the timescale of galaxy evolution \\cite{ferrini1994evolution}. Progressive enrichment of galaxies throughout the disc has been agreed in the literature for a long time \\cite{greener2022sdss} but timescales of arm saturation indicate spiral arms remain a feature of galaxies until death. High mass galaxies are shown to have lower average stellar metallicities at later times [not sure come back].

When measuring star formation a lot of the direct light is obscured by the surrounding dense gaseous-dusty environment requiring indirect indicators. Re-emission of direct young stellar light by dust in the far infra-red (FIR) range is used as an indirect indictor. [Correlation between the radio continuum and the FIR emission allows - NEED TO INCLUDE RC AT SOME POINT].  The grain heating has to be non-ionising and so 76% of the FIR luminosity can be assumed to have come from non ionising light from young stars emitting in the range $912-300\\, \\mathring{A}$ \\cite{xu1990heating}. This constrains their masses to be supernovae progenitors in the range $5-20\\, M_\\odot$.  Conversely heating contributions from the older stellar population cannot be ignored and induce uncertainty into the measurement of SFRs. $H_\\alpha$ images of spiral galaxies demonstrate lack of arm/inter-arm contrast indicating a significant portion of IR emission has not arisen from heating in the star forming regions \\cite{kulkarni1991high}.

The cultivated stellar population in spiral arms demonstrates angular momentum bi-modality in young stars where purely stellar dynamical origins would affect the entire population \\cite{semczuk2023spiral}. The angular momentum gap is explained to be due to the position of young stars largely representing their birth place, where older stars coherence from their origin is removed by phase mixing and perturbations. [Janky sentence]  This feature demonstrates a relationship between stellar age and position within the spiral arm. This relationship is supported by stellar age gradients across spiral arms that were measured from the velocity and spectra of the star moving away from the centre of the density wave \\cite{vallee2022catalog}. [LINKING SENTENCE BETWEEN PROGENITORS AND SNE].  Strong correlation between the decline rate of type Ia SNe light curves and position relative to spiral arms is found before and after co-rotation \\cite{karapetyan2022constraining}. SNe are often found at the inner and outer shock fronts and hence represent the final stage of the progenitor evolution heading out of the spiral arm.
