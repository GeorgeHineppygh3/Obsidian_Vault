Beautiful grand design spiral galaxies have come to embody the image of astronomy, but much of the role the arms themselves play and the physics which drives their evolution is not entirely clear.  By using non-parametric fitting of disc profiles to multiband images of galaxies to extract morphological features, detailed analysis of the luminosity and colour contributions to the overall photometric profile can be carried out. This review will focus on using these techniques to extract spiral arms utilising the JAX adapted GALFITM code, GAX. Current literature states that spiral structure is a result of propagating density waves consisting of molecular and atomic gas, dust and stars \\cite{[POTENTIALLY SHOULD REFERENCE THIS]}.
