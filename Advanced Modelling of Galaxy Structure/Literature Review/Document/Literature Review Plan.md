Description from module handbook of 4th Year project:

'It should begin with a concise summary of the project you have been set, then broaden to describe the background physics and the methods you will use in conducting the project'

Document containing suggested structure
[Project Lit Review and Plan FAQs- phys4015.pdf](../../../PDFs/Project%20Lit%20Review%20and%20Plan%20FAQs-%20phys4015.pdf)

Previously already reviewed literature sorted by topic:
[Previous Applicable work](../Notes/Previous%20Applicable%20work.md)

## Introduction:

- Summary of the project:
	- Measuring colour, intensity and winding of spiral arms by subtracting the disc from spiral galaxies using GAX
	- Uses of GAX so far as a continuation of Galfit/GalfitM
	- Existing work (FICL + Stevens work etc)
- Broaden into general morphological features
- use GAX to fit disc profiles to the GZ front on spirals at first
- Extract the 'non parametric' parts of the fit to separate images (this will hopefully remove the spiral arms only after some manipulation of the code) 
- Apply statistical analysis to the colour/percentage flux (of arm in reference to whole galaxy) 
- Analyse the spiral properties in reference to morphology and evolution (winding angle and colour etc) 
- When all of that works I think we are going to try and expand it to the larger GZ data set with slightly more inclined galaxies 
- After this I think Steven mentioned DECALS data set and perhaps trying another data set to get more data for stat analysis

### Advice from Steven:

-	going to be hard to fit in
-	send steven the article around early Jan
-	Latex bibtex referencing is king
-	email about jan meeting
-	word limit is a guide can push it
-	try and be brief
-	more links = better (but don't force it)
-	standard referencing for astronomy is Harvard
-	'as was shown by hart (Hart et. al 2018; Johnston 2017)'
-	mixture of that and the backup style
-	put e.g. to acknowledge that you have curated examples
-	GAX news - lots of funding came in - nina came in clutch

## List of things to talk about

- disc and spiral structure
- existing work on spiral structure:      (TOO BROAD MAYBE DELETE)
	- [Galaxy Zoo and SPARCFIRE - constraints on spiral arm formation mechanisms from spiral arm number and pitch angles - Review](Galaxy%20Zoo%20and%20SPARCFIRE%20-%20constraints%20on%20spiral%20arm%20formation%20mechanisms%20from%20spiral%20arm%20number%20and%20pitch%20angles%20-%20Review.md)
	- 
- how spiral structure relates to galaxy evolution
	- density waves (Lindblad) and the disproof (see SPARCFIRE paper link) 
	- how many rotations does a galaxy do with spiral structure
- how spiral arms influence SFR

- temperature of spiral arms vs disc
	- 
- the composition of spiral arms (what does this mean?)

## How are we going to split this list into structure/Plan?


## Conclusion:

- how the project does something useful
- how it is different from similar work


## Similar work:
- shorturl.at/nuvyE

- asa bluck 'the bulge is king'
- bulge correlation to halo mass quenching
- red spirals still have blue
- high z ifu obs of sf spirals clusters saw (position in cluster doesnt affect sfr) stars from in centres of galaxies in clusters
