The over density of stellar fuel results in increased star formation and hence a large population of young stars \\cite{cepa1993density}. The molecular and atomic gas concentrations within the arms are enriched by the stellar population resulting in positive metallicity gradients towards the centre of spiral arms \\cite{poggio2022chemical}. The metal enrichment from heavier elements demonstrates a diverse stellar population which is confirmed by the younger hotter stars representing larger inhomogeneities in the spiral arms. As a consequence of the density waves concentrating gas/stellar fuel the dense metal rich arms provide the perfect environment for star formation.
