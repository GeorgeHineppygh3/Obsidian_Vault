In 1961 Lindblad \\cite{lindblad1961gravitational} demonstrated that under resonance conditions gravitational perturbations could lead to the emergence of spiral structure in N body computational models. Later work carried out by Lin and Shu  \\cite{lin1987spiral} provided a plausible basis that spiral structure could arise out of gravitational instability. The work expands upon Lindblad's evidence that epicycles of gravitating bodies would enter resonance with the spiral pattern at three distinct points: co-rotation, inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and outer Lindblad resonance (OLR). Lin and Shu demonstrated an asymptotic solution to the spiral density wave which was later proven only able to grow constrained between the ILR and OLR \\cite{binney2011galactic}.  However density wave structure has been shown to extend to the 4:1 resonance, far beyond the OLR, suggesting that other physics governs the structure beyond certain resonances. 

The density waves at the resonance points are governed by non linear affects which are explained by the invariant manifolds of unstable chaotic periodic orbits \\cite{voglis2006invariant} which form two families each  terminating at the LaGrange points $L_1$ and $L_2$ situated, in barred spirals, at the ends of the bar. Manifold theory demonstrates that the position of the apocenters of the unstable periodic orbits remain correlated for significant timescales; enough to support density waves outside of co-rotation. Subsequent work \\cite{contopoulos2022spiral} has shown that Lin, Shu and Lindblad's resonance and precessing ellipses theory governs spiral structure at radii before co-rotation and the invariant manifold explanation explains the continuation of the structure beyond.

Explanations of the origin of spiral structure all stem from the differences in pattern speeds of morphological features within galaxy discs. By assuming the pattern speed of the bar within $Sb$ type galaxies to be much larger than the pattern speed of the spiral arms, the arm can be considered a perturbing potential to the bar \\cite{harsoula2022perturbed}.  In this case the stable periodic orbits inside co-rotation are transformed to thick qausi-periodic orbits. The superposition of these orbits creates a slightly perturbed spiral structure.  

The bar has also been demonstrated to influence the spiral structure with spirals without bars having $4^\\circ-6^\\circ$ tighter wound arms \\cite{hart2017galaxy}. It is generally agreed that the bar is a mechanism for transport of quantities of gas from large to small radii \\cite{ryder1992optical} \\cite{yu2022edge}.  With the manifolds of the chaotic orbits terminating at the LaGrange points at either end of the bar, the influence of the feature as part of the evolution of the central bulge mass and galaxy as a whole becomes clear.  Conversely however it has been argued that due to the lack of bulge mass influence over the pitch angle of spiral arms that not all spiral arms are governed by density waves \\cite{hart2017galaxy}.

Although spiral structure can be explained by internal galaxy physics there is also evidence that external galaxy-galaxy interactions are responsible for influencing or accelerating structure development. Distant tidal interactions have been shown in N body simulations to perturb spiral structure and concentrate specifically two armed spiral densities \\cite{ramos2022tidally}.
