The spiral arms of galaxies act as sweeping star factories in the discs of spiral galaxies. By using non parametric fitting expanded from GALFITM into GAX the model based exclusion of the spiral arms from the disc will reduce the uncertainty in spiral arm extraction and allow for measurement of the luminosity ratio's between disc and arms in multiple bands. Understanding the wavelength based contribution of luminosity from the dense star forming regions in a large sample of galaxies will help to explain the arms role in the evolution of the galaxy.
