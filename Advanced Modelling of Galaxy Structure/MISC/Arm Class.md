|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Grand Design              | Tightly wound, well-defined, and continuous spiral arms that extend from the center to the outer regions of the galaxy.                                                                    |

| Multi-Arm                 | Multiple spiral arms with varying degrees of tightness and definition, often exhibiting a mix of grand design and flocculent characteristics.                                              |
| Ring                      | A ring-like structure that encircles the central bulge or disk of the galaxy, often appearing as a distinct circle or oval shape.                                                          |

| Barred Spiral             | Spiral arms that originate from a central bar structure instead of directly from the galactic center, often associated with barred spiral galaxies (SBa-SBd in the De Vaucouleurs system). |
| No Spiral Arms            | Galaxies that do not exhibit any visible spiral arms, either due to their low luminosity or absence of spiral structure.                                                                   |
