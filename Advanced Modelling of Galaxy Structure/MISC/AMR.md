The simplest form of the AMR is a power law relationship between the metallicity and the age of a stellar population:

$$Z(t) = Z_0(t/t_0)^p$$

where Z(t) is the metallicity at a given age t, Z_0 is the initial metallicity at t=t_0, and p is the slope of the power law. This equation assumes that the metallicity increases steadily with time, with a constant rate of enrichment.

However, this simple form of the AMR does not always accurately describe the complex processes that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies. In reality, the rate of metallicity increase can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as the efficiency of star formation, the inflow and outflow of gas, and the impact of supernovae and other feedback processes.

To account for these complexities, more sophisticated models of the AMR have been developed, such as chemical evolution models. These models take into account the physics of gas accretion, star formation, and feedback, and use numerical simulations to predict the metallicity evolution of galaxies over time. They can also be used to fit observed data on the metallicity and age distributions of stars in a given galaxy, in order to infer the underlying physical processes at work.

Overall, the AMR provides a useful framework for understanding the chemical history of galaxies and the formation of stars and planets within them. Its mathematical formalism allows astronomers to make quantitative predictions and test theoretical models against observations, in order to better understand the complex processes that govern the evolution of the universe.

#### Other more complex models include:

1.  Exponential Model:

$$Z(t) = Z_0 + Ae^{(-t/τ)}$$

where $Z_0$ is the initial metallicity, $A$ is a constant, τ is the timescale for metal enrichment, and $t$ is the age of the stellar population. This equation assumes that the metallicity increases exponentially with time, and that the rate of enrichment decreases over time.

2.  Linear-Exponential Model:

$$Z(t) = Z_0 + At + Be^{(-t/τ)}$$

where A and B are constants. This model combines a linear increase in metallicity with an exponential decrease, allowing for more flexibility in fitting observational data.

3.  Closed-Box Model:

$$Z(t) = Z_{max}(1 - e^{(-t/τ)})$$

where $Z_{max}$ is the maximum possible metallicity for the stellar population, and τ is the timescale for metal enrichment. This model assumes that the system is a "closed box" with no inflow or outflow of gas, and that all metals produced by stars  retained by the system.

4.  Inflow-Outflow Model:

$$Z(t) = (Γ - η)M(t)/M_g + Z_in$$

where Γ is the inflow rate of gas, η is the outflow rate of gas, M(t) is the mass of the stellar population at time t, $M_g$ is the mass of the gas reservoir, and $Z_in$ is the metallicity of the inflowing gas. This model takes into account the inflow and outflow of gas, which can influence the metallicity evolution of a galaxy.

5.  Dual-Inflow Model:

$$Z(t) = (Γ_1 + Γ_2t)M(t)/M_g + Z_in$$

where $Γ_1$ and $Γ_2$ are the inflow rates of two different gas components, and t is the age of the stellar population. This model allows for the possibility of multiple gas reservoirs with different inflow rates and metallicities.

These more complex equations for the AMR take into account the complex physical processes involved in galaxy formation and evolution, and can provide more accurate predictions and better fits to observational data than simple power-law models.

#### Which model best fits open blue disk spirals:

Studies have found that a combination of a linear-exponential model and a closed-box model can provide a good fit to the metallicity distribution in Open Blue Disk (OBD) galaxies, as it allows for a range of metallicity evolution scenarios. The linear-exponential model can describe the initial rapid metallicity enrichment of the galaxy, while the closed-box model can account for the subsequent slower enrichment.

However, it should be noted that this is not the only possible combination of models, and other models that take into account radial mixing, inflow/outflow of gas, or other physical processes may also provide good fits to the metallicity distribution of spiral arms in OBD galaxies. The best model or combination of models will depend on the specific observational data and the physical properties of the galaxy being studied.

### Once we have decided on which one:

- link to [Stellar Population Model](./Stellar%20Population%20Model.md) 
- This can be very rough but would be nice to give an estimate even if it is absolutely covered in caveats and assumptions
- Can explain how the uncertainty on this is basically insignificant and then list all of the reddening reasons - plenty to talk about
