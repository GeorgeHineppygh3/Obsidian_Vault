◦	Get the top 20 components
◦	Wait, the list of top 20 components by signal-to-noise
◦	Inverse Fourier transform the top 20 components
◦	Add that to the image in a different colour
◦	Create a line that goes through the centre of that distribution
◦	Create a series of tangent to the line based on the gradient of a line at the point
◦	Regular grid, interpolate along line and create image
◦	Is there anything that can be learned from the top 20 components printed in an image what on the isolated version compare to the original version?
