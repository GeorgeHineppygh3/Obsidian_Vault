**Describe how resonance conditions in spiral galaxies produce spiral structure before the co-rotation radius?**

In spiral galaxies, the spiral structure is often thought to be produced by resonance conditions, where the stars and gas in the disk are trapped in specific orbits that are in resonance with the perturbations caused by the spiral arms.

The two most important resonances are the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) and the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR). The ILR occurs when the orbital frequency of a star is twice the pattern speed of the spiral arm, while the OLR occurs when the orbital frequency is equal to the pattern speed.

The region of the galaxy where the ILR occurs is known as the Inner Lindblad Resonance Zone (ILRZ), while the region where the OLR occurs is known as the Outer Lindblad Resonance Zone (OLRZ).

The spiral structure in a galaxy is thought to be produced by the interaction of stars and gas in the disk with the spiral density wave, which causes perturbations in the gravitational potential. The perturbations can create regions of compression and rarefaction in the gas, leading to enhanced star formation in the compressed regions.

Before the co-rotation radius, which is the radius at which the rotation speed of the disk matches the pattern speed of the spiral arm, the ILRZ is located inside the spiral arms, while the OLRZ is located outside the spiral arms. The ILR causes stars and gas to be trapped in orbits that are elongated along the direction of the spiral arm, while the OLR causes orbits that are elongated perpendicular to the arm. This produces a region of enhanced star formation along the leading edge of the spiral arm, where the gas is compressed by the combined effect of the ILR and the spiral arm perturbation.

Thus, resonance conditions in spiral galaxies produce spiral structure before the co-rotation radius by trapping stars and gas in specific orbits that are in resonance with the perturbations caused by the spiral arms. The resulting perturbations in the gravitational potential can create regions of compression and rarefaction in the gas, leading to enhanced star formation in the compressed regions along the leading edge of the spiral arm.

## TLDR:

-   Resonance conditions occur when stars and gas in a spiral galaxy are trapped in specific orbits that are in resonance with the perturbations caused by the spiral arms.
-   The two most important resonances are the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) and the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR).
-   The Inner Lindblad Resonance Zone (ILRZ) and Outer Lindblad Resonance Zone (OLRZ) are regions of the galaxy where the ILR and OLR occur, respectively.
-   Before the co-rotation radius, the ILRZ is located inside the spiral arms, while the OLRZ is located outside the spiral arms.
-   The ILR causes stars and gas to be trapped in orbits that are elongated along the direction of the spiral arm, while the OLR causes orbits that are elongated perpendicular to the arm.
-   This produces a region of enhanced star formation along the leading edge of the spiral arm, where the gas is compressed by the combined effect of the ILR and the spiral arm perturbation.

**Describe how the invariant manifolds of chaotic orbits maintain spiral arm structure beyond coronation?**

In a galactic disk, the orbits of stars and gas can be influenced by various perturbations, such as gravitational interactions with neighbouring galaxies or with the galactic bar. These perturbations can create chaos in the motion of the stars and gas, leading to the formation of complex and irregular structures in the galactic disk, such as spiral arms.

In addition to these chaotic orbits, there exist a special class of orbits called invariant manifolds, which are stable structures that are preserved over time. Invariant manifolds can be thought of as the "skeleton" of the chaotic orbits in the disk, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the structure of the spiral arms beyond the co-rotation radius.

The co-rotation radius is the radius in the disk where the rotational speed of the material in the disk matches the speed of the spiral density wave. Inside the co-rotation radius, the spiral arms move faster than the material in the disk, while outside the co-rotation radius, the material moves faster than the spiral arms. This creates a region of overlap between the material and the spiral arms, where the spiral arms can interact with the material and influence its motion.

The invariant manifolds of chaotic orbits are important in maintaining the structure of the spiral arms beyond the co-rotation radius because they serve as "conduits" that channel material into and out of the overlap region. The invariant manifolds act as boundaries that separate the chaotic orbits that are inside the spiral arms from those that are outside the arms.

As material in the disk moves through the overlap region, it interacts with the spiral arms and is deflected towards or away from the arms, depending on its location with respect to the invariant manifolds. The material that is deflected towards the arms can be compressed, leading to enhanced star formation, while the material that is deflected away from the arms can form gaps in the disk.

Thus, the invariant manifolds of chaotic orbits play a crucial role in maintaining the structure of the spiral arms beyond the co-rotation radius by serving as conduits that channel material into and out of the overlap region. The interaction between the material and the spiral arms can lead to enhanced star formation and the formation of gaps in the disk, shaping the overall structure and evolution of the galaxy.

## TLDR:

-   Invariant manifolds are stable structures that are preserved over time, and they can be thought of as the "skeleton" of the chaotic orbits in the disk.
-   Chaotic orbits in a galactic disk can be influenced by perturbations that create chaos in their motion, leading to the formation of complex and irregular structures such as spiral arms.

-   The invariant manifolds of chaotic orbits are important in maintaining the structure of the spiral arms beyond the co-rotation radius by serving as "conduits" that channel material into and out of the overlap region between the spiral arms and the material.

**Describe the distributions of extincting dust in spiral arms and the contribution it plays to colour change across the arms?**

The distribution of dust in spiral arms is not uniform, but instead, it is clumpy and patchy. This is because dust grains are not well-mixed within the interstellar medium, but instead, they are concentrated in dense clouds and filaments. The dust in spiral arms is usually found in molecular clouds, which are regions of high gas density where stars are forming.

The dust in spiral arms can cause reddening or extinction of starlight, meaning that the light is absorbed and scattered by dust grains, making the stars appear fainter and redder than they actually are. The amount of extinction depends on the distance from the observer to the star and the amount of dust along that line of sight. Therefore, the distribution of dust in spiral arms can cause significant changes in the apparent colour of stars across the arms.

The contribution of dust extinction to colour change across spiral arms can be quantified using the colour excess parameter, E(B-V). E(B-V) is the difference between the observed colour of a star and its intrinsic colour, caused by the absorption of blue light by dust grains along the line of sight. The value of E(B-V) can be estimated by comparing the observed colours of stars in different filters, such as the B and V filters, with the colours they would have if there were no dust along the line of sight.

The distribution of dust in spiral arms can lead to variations in E(B-V) across the arms. For example, if a spiral arm contains a dense dust cloud along one line of sight, stars behind that cloud will appear more reddened than stars in other parts of the arm. This can create a colour gradient across the arm, with stars appearing bluer on one side and redder on the other side.

In addition to causing colour changes, the dust in spiral arms can also affect the morphology of the arms. The absorption and scattering of starlight by dust can create complex patterns of light and dark regions in the arms, with bright knots and filaments where there is little dust and dark lanes where there is a lot of dust.

Overall, the clumpy and patchy distribution of dust in spiral arms can cause significant variations in the apparent colour of stars across the arms, creating colour gradients and complex patterns of light and dark regions.

## TLDR:

-   Dust in spiral arms is distributed clumpy and patchy, concentrated in molecular clouds where stars are forming.

How does measuring the Chi squared between the image and the uncertainty improve the fit in the next iteration? 

This is the basics of fitting a function to data, so you will be able to find information about this in many places. 
Here is a ‘quick’ summary:

chisq = sum((O_i-E_i)^2/S_i^2), where O_i is the observed value of pixel i, E_i is the expected value (given the current parameters of the model), and S_i is the uncertainty on O_i. It is therefore the square of the difference between the observed data and the model, normalised by the uncertainty. Finding model parameters that minimise the chisq therefore gets the model as close as possible to the observed data, taking the uncertainties into account. From a more statistical perspective, it is common to consider the probability of the data given a model, called the ‘likelihood’; for Gaussian uncertainties, chisq is half of the negative log likelihood. Minimising chisq (maximising the likelihood) is what is generally meant by ‘fitting’ a model to data. In some special cases, i.e. a straight line with homoscedastic data, this problem can be solved directly via matrix inversion. In general, though, an iterative method is required; these are generally known as gradient descent. All these algorithms try to choose steps (changes in the model parameter values) heading ‘downhill’ towards the minimum chisq. A common algorithm is Levenburg-Marquardt (L-M), which makes use of all the individual data points to choose particularly efficient steps to the nearest local minimum. However, in problems with very large number of parameters and/or data points and/or non-chisq loss-functions, all typically encountered in machine learning, alternatives are used. Often these are intuitively quite simple: iteratively find the vector gradient of the loss function (e.g. chisq) in parameter space and take a small step in that direction.

## TLDR:

-   Chi squared (χ²) is a measure of the goodness of fit between observed data and a model's predictions.
-   It quantifies the squared difference between observed values (Oᵢ) and expected values (Eᵢ) from the model, normalized by the uncertainties (Sᵢ) associated with the observed data.
-   The formula for calculating chi squared is: χ² = Σ((Oᵢ - Eᵢ)² / Sᵢ²), where Σ represents summation over all data points.
-   Minimizing chi squared helps to find model parameters that bring the model predictions as close as possible to the observed data, taking uncertainties into account.
-   In statistical terms, minimizing chi squared is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of the data given the model.
-   For Gaussian uncertainties, chi squared is half of the negative log likelihood.
-   Matrix inversion can directly solve the fitting problem in certain cases (e.g., straight line with homoscedastic data), but in general, iterative methods like gradient descent are used.
-   Gradient descent algorithms iteratively update the model parameters by taking steps in the direction of steepest descent towards the minimum chi squared.
-   Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) is a common algorithm that utilizes all data points to efficiently find steps towards the nearest local minimum.
-   In machine learning, alternative algorithms may be used due to large parameter or data sizes, or when dealing with non-chi squared loss functions.
-   Generally, these alternative algorithms involve iteratively computing the gradient of the loss function (e.g., chi squared) in parameter space and taking small steps in that direction.
