#### Attendance:
- Steven

 - Shivani 
 - George 

#### Topics covered:

- matching catalogues
- add the d2d from the nearest neighbour search as a column and have a look at the histogram
- can apply a cut saying d2d $< 1 \\;arcsec$ 
- plotted histogram of d2d in python
- fixed plotting on top of image
	- try using rotation as the argument of the `p_max` component
- 


#### Suggested work going forward:

figures for paper:

- galaxy before and after non param (3subplots)
- wavelength variation of the flux fraction (3 galaxies)
- circles and arms and then r theta amplitude of the Fourier components
- plots to summarise over a large sample 100-1,000-10,000
- understand the data and presented the data (flux frac for a large number)
- brighter galaxies stronger spiral arms etc
- science plot's are there (there is a trend and demonstrate the trend is there)
- stellar mass against flux fraction
- colour u-r !!! do blue galaxies tend to have more spiral arms
- fractions in different bands and look at their colours
- could do many simple things that could 
- NEED KILLER FIGURES 
- pitch angle vs colours
- use the offsets of the angles in the r theta to show that there is a difference in each band across a stat sample (large N)
- have most of the figures done by the viva
- explain each figure ( slide per figure pretty much) - [Say the caption out-loud]
- structure for report (plan this)
- 50 pages report

===============================================================

need to exclude the bulge
histogram of flux fraction
normalise by the R band flux frac  - removes spread through trend

plotting the gradient of the trend - might see a bump

outcome - extraction removes arms and bulge - we masked it out
we could also run again

examine a low and high and look at their arm dominance - this shows 

mask out M52
mask as-well for SFT
the IR is 8 micron and so is PAH dust emission

use the distance to the galaxies for angular size - this will be better than the fit
co-rotation - possible discontinuity at this point
high res means could extract using gaussian


to run on the large image
