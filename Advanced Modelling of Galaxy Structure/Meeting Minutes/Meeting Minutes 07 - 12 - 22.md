#### Attendance:

- Steven

 - Shivani 
 - George 



#### Topics covered:

- Borris Hoysler (gamamorph and megamorph) GALFITm
	- BUDDI with Evelyn Johnston and Borris Hoylser
- GALFIT3 later (spiral arms and bars etc)
- Karen Masters papers from the last ten years
- First demonstrate the arms have been extracted properly
- GALFIT3D MANGA from IFU data from SDSS 

want to contrast the IFU method using picture areas which contain the arms
and with the model fitting and subtraction using modelling (IFU uses spectra but we want to use images instead but they are basically just low res spectra) (don't rule it out)


#### Suggested work going forward:

1. gather notes and papers for literature review
2. create bullet point plan for lit review
3. create structure for lit review (prose and paragraph structure fill in detail with references later)
4. read papers
