2. discussed how to use ficl for the fitting and using own data instead of test data
3. discussed how we would need to incorporate multiband features and issues with that:
	- psf
	- chebyshev polynomial coefficients
	- easier way of doing things

#### Suggested work going forward:

1. run ficl code on test
2. run ficl code on non test image
3. work out how to run the ficl code in the testing notebook
