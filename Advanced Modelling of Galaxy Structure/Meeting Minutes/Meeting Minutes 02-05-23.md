#### Attendance:
- Steven

 - Shivani 
 - George 

#### Topics covered:

- Shivani's extinction map
- Do not model extinction - fine to present data and talk about dust qualitatively 
- Why FICL modelling can sometimes subtract off the dust lane
- Stat problems over 1


#### Suggested work going forward:

- Compare the total sum of flux and then compare that to the magnitude
- Within half a magnitude or 1 magnitude then be pleased
- Make magnitude map using calibrated (B-V)
- Can get extinction but would require several assumptions
- Two colours can do both using iterative method
- Demonstrate a change in the signal to noise for SFT 
	- Does the FICL change the inner radius lot
	- does FICL change its estimation of angle 
	- does FICL help with 
- How does the Colour change look different in the FICL isolated image
- Argument against the non-parametric - could chop off the bottom of the spiral arm peaks
- Explore what the profile looks like in somewhere where there is no dust
- Do we see blue bits poking through the dust lane?
- 

Need to demonstrate for the purpose of the project the viability of the non - parametric fitting
why does it help having them on there own

Why FICL helps us to isolate the stuff that we want to study

Run SFT on an image that has been filtered in many wyas

Look for anomalously low pixels that could be squeing it

Over subtraction of the background is a known problem in SLOAN!!

Blanton et al 2011 - Better SDSS background subtraction

Bernadi 2007 - aswell

The avreage is skewed in larger brighter galaxies this is our sample

maybe go and hget the redone images taht are the problem

do a radial profile and look for dip below zero - easier and do first0
