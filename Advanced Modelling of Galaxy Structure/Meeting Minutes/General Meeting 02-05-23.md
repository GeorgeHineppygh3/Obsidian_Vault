- Everyone in year 4

## Lecturer:

- Tony Kent

===============================================================

## Viva:

5 Minutes long
5 Slides

1. Outline the aims and objectives of your project - 1 slide
2. summarise what you have done in the project so far - 1-2 slides
3. highlight any significant results you have obtained - 1-2 slides
4. finish with your plans for the final days - 1 slide

Learn about the resonances
Learn about the Invariant manifolds

Be prepared for basic physics undergrad questions on the concepts:

- Create a list of what these things could be!

Keep checking moodle for time/date/room change
Could end up with only one member of staff

Best prep is just know your project very well

If viva is cancelled get average of other grades

===============================================================

## Report:

The progress you have made on the research topic

The project quality and amount of work you have done

your scientific approach

your conduct of the project; originality and organisation

your critical analysis of the findings and discussion

your critical analysis of the findings and discussion

your understanding of the project and relevant underlying physics



you are not writing it for an expert in the field you are writing it for someone who is familiar with astronomy but NOT AN EXPERT 

make it accessible 

aim it at the level of a masters student working in your field

second marker is not from the field - get an understanding from another field

Introduction and conclusion must be accessible for the broader physics community

## What to include:

24th May 2023 12:00pm Moodle

- Report
- Student's declaration: download from moodle the form - confidential
- Supplementary material - code notebooks etc - no need to submit diary - they will find it on teams - speak to steven about this

- There is going to be pizza on the day lol

How long?

- Module handbook has guidance on length
- Will not be penalised unless it is unnecessarily long or short
- No strict word count
- Quality is what counts
- Threes - 50 Pages ~ 12,500 words

50 ENTIRE PAGES OH MY LORD

NO code - put it in the electronic supplementary appendix

### Should we include things we tried but did not work?

Depends - if tried then something else worked - passing briefly

If nothing worked at all discuss all the approaches and discuss why they didn't work and what caused the failure

### How many references?

- Varies just make sure if you say something and someone else backs it up you mention them
- Irrelevant or inappropriate references will be penalised
- Format is whatever you chose - whatever is used in the field (only want consistency)


### Distribution of work:

- You don't need to go into detail on the distribution of work
- If someone did all the comp work then say that
- Not paragraphs and sentences but bullet points maybe with the key work package vs contribution


### Timeline:

- Report should follow the logical flow and make sense
- Report does not have to follow the into method result discussion conclusion etc - instead think about how best it logically flows together 


### Progress has been held up by:

- Explain illness (NHS 111)
- Project Partners not trying very hard
