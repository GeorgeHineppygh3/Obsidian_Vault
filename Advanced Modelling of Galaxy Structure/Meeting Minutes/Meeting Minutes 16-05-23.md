pedestool is caussing the star artifacts

- dilate the mask by a set amount such that it covers more of the star pedestal

you have used i use j and k instead or something else

use ln(r) instead of u

all functions should be upright instead of italics

labels in subscript should also be upright use \\text or \\textrm

as long as you keep i and j consistent then it is fine
