#### Attendance:

 - Shivani 
 - George 



#### Topics covered:

-  What are we going to measure?
	1. Winding angle and number of arms (subject to 2dfft)
	2. Colour intensity gradients (subject to 2dfft working)
	3. fraction of flux from the arms in each band
	4. some way of measuring the continuity if the arms in each band
	5. Winding against age? 

- What would this tell us?
	1. Would give us a fit for measuring gradients towards shock fronts
	2. Could tell us about the distribution of young/old stars in the arm
	3. Could tell us about the distribution of young/old stars in the arm and could relate this to the 
	4. not sure what clumpyness would tell you
	5. would be good evidence for the 

#### Suggested work going forward:

Aden:
- get the gpu running
- run on a fits file

Shivani:
- sort out logger error
- run on a fits file


George:
- 2dfft sort it out
