'As predicted by theory (Mishurov et al. 2009) and seen in simulations (Lépine et al. 2001) and observations (e.g., Marochnik et al. 1972; Mishurov & Zenina 1999; Dias & Lépine 2005; Amôres et al. 2009; Elmegreen et al. 2009; Lépine et al. 2011), corotation has a “pumping out” effect: the corotation barrier produces gas flows in opposite directions on the two sides of corotation, with radial gas flows inward inside corotation and outward on the other side' - Garner et. al
