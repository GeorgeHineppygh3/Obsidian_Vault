'The overall average gas-phase extinction is about 1.18 mag. The core region of M51 presents a larger gas-phase extinction than the outside.'

'From the extinction map in Figure 4, we can also see that the extinction in the northern spiral arms is generally smaller than the southern ones.'

- That is good we have the galaxy upside down so therefore the bottom one is the north and that is arm 1

'All the emission-line fluxes are corrected for the gas-phase extinction.'

'interacting systems present shallower metallicity gradients compared to the isolated galaxies' - Kewley et al. (2010) and Sanchez et al. (2014)

## Intrinsic vs observed

TLDR: intrinsic is smaller observed is larger as $H_\\beta$ is absorbed more readily

The observed flux ratio for Hα and Hβ is the ratio of the measured fluxes of these two hydrogen emission lines that are observed in a spectrum. The intrinsic flux ratio, on the other hand, is the ratio of the fluxes that would be emitted by the gas producing the lines, assuming no attenuation by dust or other factors.

The intrinsic flux ratio of Hα and Hβ can be calculated using the intrinsic ratio of the hydrogen emission lines, which is 2.86. This ratio arises from the physics of hydrogen atoms and the transitions between energy levels that produce the emission lines. The intrinsic ratio can be used to derive the electron density and temperature of the gas that produces the emission lines.

However, the observed flux ratio of Hα and Hβ is often different from the intrinsic ratio due to various factors that can affect the measurements. One major factor is dust extinction, which can cause the Hβ flux to be more strongly absorbed than the Hα flux, resulting in a larger observed Hα/Hβ flux ratio than the intrinsic value. Another factor is the instrumental response of the observation system, which can affect the calibration of the flux measurements.

Therefore, the difference between the observed and intrinsic flux ratio for Hα and Hβ can provide information about the properties of the interstellar medium, such as the amount of dust extinction or the electron density and temperature of the emitting gas. To correct for the effects of dust extinction and other factors, various techniques can be used, such as reddening correction or Balmer decrement analysis, to derive the intrinsic flux ratio and the physical properties of the emitting gas.
