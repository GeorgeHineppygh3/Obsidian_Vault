'We cite in particular the study of Elmegreen et al. (1989), who, like Tully (1974) argue that OLR occurs at the termination of the bright, inner spiral structure and in the pretext of mode-coupling therein identify an overlap between the CR of the inner pattern with the ILR of a 10Y20 km s1 kpc1 outer pattern (e.g., that first proposed for the material pattern by Tully 1974). This places the innermost extent of the material pattern at r 6:0 kpc (adopted into the distance convention used here). Vogel et al. (1993) also argue for a similar corotation radius based on observations of streaming motions in the ionized gas component of the ISM. And while this does not locate the inner extent of the outer pattern, it nevertheless implies that the outer arms are separate from, and have a lower pattern speed than, the inner arms (Vogel et al. 1993). Consequently, it is consistent with the conclusion of Elmegreen et al. (1989).'

- Indication of a resonance at 6kpc but cannot be 4:1 as this would mov the ILR too far out - and cannot be the outer as ILR would be too close
- Tully (1974a) derived the same CR using linear density-wave theory based on the observed rate of opening ofthe spiral arms and the rotation curve, making the assumption that the ILR occurs where the spiral arms begin. Elmegreen et al. (1989) used a power law rotation curve combined with the assumption that certain morphological features occur at resonances to arrive at a similar conclusion -   [so 4.8kpc] 

But also seems to think the 6kpc resonance is probably the corotation resonance

'Surprisingly, the largest star-formation complexes and the most enhanced star-formation efficiencies occur close to CR. This is contrary to suggestions that a minimum in the star-formation efficiency should occur near CR (i.e., Visser 1980; Cepa and Beckman 1990), and indicates that star-formation efficiency is not a reliable indicator of the location of the corotation resonance' - don't use SFR for Corotation

Bastain reckons the effective radius is ∼7.3×8.1 Kpc - incorrect
