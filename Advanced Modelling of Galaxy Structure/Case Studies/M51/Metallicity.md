We want to find some measurements of the local metallicity over the 0.3-0.7$R_e$ spiral arm range.

Need to find a radial distribution

We know the radii of all the normal points therefore if we make a 2d disk exponential and then squash it according to the image and place it at the relative centre and then sample the normal points out of it we will be able to get approximate metallicity values.

## Important distinction:

Gas phase metallicity is not Stellar metallicity

Gas-phase metallicity refers to the abundance of chemical elements heavier than helium (i.e., metals) in the interstellar medium of a galaxy or a star-forming region.

Stellar metallicity refers to the abundance of heavy elements in the stars themselves.


## Papers where this has been done:

- [Physical Properties of H II Regions in M51 from Spectroscopic Observations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03188.pdf) 

'There is a negative metallicity gradient of −0.08 dex  $R^{−1}_e$ in the disk region, which is also commonly found in many spiral galaxies.' - Gas phase

'We find a positive abundance gradient of 0.26 dex $R^{−1}_e$ in the inner region'

Where is the 'Inner region' - what is the difference between abundance and metallicity?

M51 - 'face-on spiral galaxy with the Hubble type of Sbc'

'There are possible reasons causing the positive gradient, including the freezing of the chemical enrichment due to the star-forming quenching in the bulge and the gas in-fall and dilution due to the pseudo-bulge growth and/or galactic interaction'

## Stellar population modelling:

'The underlying stellar continuum of each spectrum is modeled with the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code. A grid of 150 simple stellar population (SSP) templates from Bruzual & Charlot (2003) 5 with the Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF) are used. These SSP templates cover 25 different ages (1 Myr–18 Gyr) and six metallicities (0.005 – 2.5 Z⊙)'

## Extinction modelling:

'The gas-phase extinction can be estimated with the Balmer line ratios, such as Hα/Hβ, Hα/Hγ, and Hβ/Hγ.'

'The extinction law of Cardelli et al. (1989)'

## Metallicity from the 03N2 Strong line

We adopt the O3N2 metallicity calibration of Marino et al. (2013), which is expressed as 
$$12 + log (O/H) = 8.533 − 0.214 × O3N2 $$

This calibration is valid in the range of $-1.1 < O3N2 < 1.7$ and the calibration uncertainty is about 0.18 dex (Marino et al. 2013).
