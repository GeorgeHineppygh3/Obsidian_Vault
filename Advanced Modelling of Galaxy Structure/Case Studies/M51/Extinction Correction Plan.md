RA: 202.469649065253
DEC: 47.1952253876512

- Create a pixel galactic co-ordinate map

- Convert the co-ords in [Physical Properties of H II Regions in M51 from Spectroscopic Observations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03188.pdf) to the same format

- Plot all of the spectra points on the image as crosses

- Create a blank image the same size and assign these pixels the extinction magnitude calculated

- Interpolate of the image and get a map
