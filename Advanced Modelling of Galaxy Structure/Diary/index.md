- Half explained by Aden - attempting this method friday


### 2023-02-10

- Attempting Aden's method
- Completed Aden's method
- created WSL environment within VSCODE
- installed all the relevant packages
- ran the code - it worked! 

### 2023-02-12

- created a notebook for testing functions and accompanying documentation found in: [Borge_test.ipynb](../../PDF%20exports/Borge_test.ipynb.md) 
- created functions for reading single band image in from a fits file into an array in [gax_fits.py](../Code/Code%20description/Python%20files/gax_fits.py.md)
- created a function which reads multiple bands from image files into composite arrays in [gax_fits.py](../../PDF%20exports/gax_fits.py.md)

### 2023-02-13

- crashed the code trying to save the `.tgz` files into the ubuntu and extract them by messing with the  write privileges  (may need to rebuild WSL - hopefully the documentation as backup will prevent any serious losses)

### 2023-02-14

- Creating [Meeting Questions 15th Febuary](../Meeting%20Questions/Meeting%20Questions%2015th%20Febuary.md) 
- enquiring as to Aden and Shivani's code running status
	- Aden : `Running`
	- Shivani : `Setting up?`
- creating plan page for getting WSL back and running [WSL fix 2023-02-14](../Code/Computing%20Devices%20+%20MISC/WSL%20fix%202023-02-14.md)


### 2023-02-15

- Had meeting [Meeting Minutes 15 - 02 - 23](../Meeting%20Minutes/Meeting%20Minutes%2015%20-%2002%20-%2023.md)

- re- installed everything (took ages lol)
- cloned ficl repos into WSL drives

### 2023-02-16 

- installed latest conda
- wsl crashed

### 2023-02-17

- kept trying to initialise the ficl environment
- realised conda is not the newest so will try updating and replacing conda

### 2023-02-20

- uninstalled and installed latest conda
- installed all the packages
- initialised ficl environment (WOOOOOO)

### 2023-02-21

- ran ficl on the test data and displayed results in [Borge_test.ipynb](../Code/Code%20description/Juptyer%20Notebooks/Borge_test.ipynb.md)
- attempt to run ficl on spiral galaxy image - multiple failures

### 2023-02-22

- had meeting with Shivani [Meeting Minutes 2023-02-22](../Meeting%20Minutes/Meeting%20Minutes%202023-02-22.md) to attempt to get the code to run on her mac - macs are a pain 
- trying to run estimate source parameters
- trying to work out what pars is
- this is not possible without knowing detection parameters

### 2023-02-23

- spoke to steven and he reckons make a source catalogue instead of trying to detect sources due to the differences between the test image and the spiral images
- created source catalogue
- created estimates for input values for test image


### 2023-02-24

- making function to generate gausssian psf's of image size

04/03/2023 - just had the idea of getting spirality to fit the arm excluded images with a spiral trace and then measuring light gradients across the arm out in different bands - added benefit would be to get arm angles and winding etc

05/03/2023 - downloaded matlab and cloned spirality - will look at making a python package from it - first want to try running on standard fits file


09/03/2023 - been working on my final module recentky so havent made any progress
Today I will be trying:
- change jax to be jax[cpu] and re run the code to see if it worked
- ![Pasted image 20230309102754.png](../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230309102754.png)
- ![Pasted image 20230309103106.png](../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230309103106.png)
- same thing again
- maybe need to check the jaxlib cpu one
- ![Pasted image 20230309103510.png](../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230309103510.png)
- seems everything else as well as stevens is in conda so installing wih conda
- ![Pasted image 20230309103555.png](../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230309103555.png)

- now both conda forge
- ![Pasted image 20230309134059.png](../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230309134059.png)
- 


12/03/2023 - VSCODE cant open WSL again - fucking classic would be nice if it just opened every time

![Pasted image 20230312114623.png](../../AA%20%20-%20%20Assets/Pasted%20image%2020230312114623.png)

- had the idea of using 2dfft to measure the spiral angle before and after extraction - what does steven think something like this would tell you about the fitting and its accuracy maybe?
-  have been reading on http://rb.gy/httdtn about 2dfft as a way of determining dominant image modes to determine number of arms going to write some code to do this.
- tried to write my own p_max vs radius - didn't realise that this repos would do it for you will try cloning it to the wsl drive tomorrow and compare


13/03/2023 
- had the idea about measuring spiral continuity in each band
- would also be interesting to know pitch angle and then from pitch angle could measure normal to the line intensity gradient to look at the light towards the shockl fron tof the wave compared to the center - would expect to see higher central intensity at lower wavelength with sharper gradient and opposite for long
- cloned repos:

# Remember when running anything sudo or trying to install anything to run:

# sudo apt-get update


problems with iraf:

Your "iraf" environment variable is not defined and could not be
determined from `/usr/local/bin/cl`.  This is are needed to find IRAF
tasks.  Before starting pyraf, define ot by doing (for example):

    export iraf=/iraf/iraf/

at the Unix command line. Actual values will depend on your IRAF installation,
and they are set during the IRAF user installation (see https://iraf-community.github.io).
Also be sure to run the "mkiraf" command to create a logion.cl
(http://www.google.com/search?q=mkiraf).

15/03/23 - created


23/03/23 
- spent a while realising that there can be no nans in the $ln(r), \\theta$ so need to create some code that works out the maximum non nan radius



24/03/23 
- started trying to plot the arm from the winding angle Fourier transform but don't think it is going to be as simple as just one angle think I need to blend the dominant frequencies together to get one continuous spiral

25/03/23
- decided ISFT is the way forward but don't like their very somple way of filtering for frequencies close to p_max

26/03/23
- came up with idea that might be able to identify arm splitting or harmonic mode degeneracy

27/03/23 
- got access to the VPN - trying to work out what needs to change in order for good data collection
- organised group
- created meeting minutes document
- create meeting questions document

- ran test data
- created function for measuring spectral flatness
- created new notebook for the running of output data from MLIS1
- ran good spirals
- imported test data

13/04/23

	- [x] estimate background for all of the images
	- [ ] run FICL on images
		- [ ] create a python file for the running of ficl on each image (custom backgrounds)
	- [ ] run SFT on images
	- [ ] run normal image on images

- [ ] run FICL on images
	- [ ] create a python file for the running of ficl on each image
		- [x] create config files
		- [x] get everything ready on the server
- [ ] run SFT on images
- [ ] run normal image on images


Ran on the server and on home machine and got the same error:
```

```

## To do:

- [x] make a plan for meeting tomorrow
- [x] make a plan for the documents and get it agreed by the troops
- had an idea for plotting number of arms against colour (might be too sensitive but we will see)
- should use existing estimates for the co-rotation radii of the case studies
- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/591516/pdf

- Need to run ficl on the case studies on the server and work out why it is erroring
seems to be running out of memory on the GPU will try with not using the pre-allocate false
- This actually worked wtf?


- get data set off of Shivani and create the running file for MLIS1 and set it running
- get CAS functions
		- change of plan (matey had a 'headache' and so has been unable to do it for the last 4 weeks - what a SHAME did it myself in two hours)
	- test them - they work
	- put them into the running file - done
	- create a notebook for processing the output - `Testing_notebook_5.ipynb` 

- Find pixel estimates for co-rotation in the case studies

#### Processing/graphs
- flux fraction (adjusted to exclude bulge)
- flux fraction (divided by R band)
- histogram of the flux fractions in each band
- best fit to flux frac gradient against colour
- mask out M52


 - examine a low and high and look at their arm dominance - this shows  that we can demonstrate arm prominence statistically instead of by human review


23-04-23

- [ ] Run M101 on the server
	- [ ] failed need to speak to steven - [Email]
	- [ ] Run SFT radial dependence on M101
- [x] Create documentation for the new functions
- [x] Have meeting
- [ ] Get a spiral fit on top of case studies (this has to work for the normal sampling)
- [ ] run normal sampling on case studies
- [ ] Create code that will run the stat functions on the server (save time) and outputs
- [ ] Research Arm class
- [ ] Fix Flux fraction
- [ ] work out co-rotation as a multiple of effective radius (M51 and M101)
	- [ ] done for M51 and added to graph see [Key Information](../Case%20Studies/M51/Key%20Information.md)

It is interesting that the deviation from a stable pitch angle occurs at around 0.7$R_e$ in the green and red and earlier in ~0.1$R_e$ the blue band.

The code drops out if the directory already exists - this has proved quite useful as it stops me from duplicating data.
