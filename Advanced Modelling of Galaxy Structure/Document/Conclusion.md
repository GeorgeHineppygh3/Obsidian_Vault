## M51

Fitting spiral arms: 
    - used FICL to fit spiral arms as accurately as possible 
    - done really well from 0.3 - 0.7 $R_e$ - stable region where fit is most accurate and reliable - we know this from next couple bullet points 
Figures from Davis paper: 
    - m = 2 - two spiral arms for majority of the fit - most confident 
    - slight overlap between m = 2 and m = 4 - child branches pop up hence algo thinks there are 4 spiral arms 
Inner radius vs pitch angle graph: 
    - pitch angel fairly stable until just after 2 estimates of corotation 
    - could be caused by regime change in physics due to huge gravitational interaction with child galaxy (M51a/M52) 
Power spectrum: 
    - from dominant harmonic mode (m = 2), which has greatest amplitude, can find the winding angle and position angle 
Distribution of colour: 
    - trailing edge is redder than leading edge - agrees with literature about where star formation occurs in the arm, migration of stars as they get older out of the arm, the movement of the pattern speed of the arm moving away from newly born stars 
    - caveats - we don’t know if all colour contribution is coming from stellar metallicity gradient - could be other sources, cannot say much more without knowing about the stellar environment 
    - there is contribution from different aged stars - we don’t know how much 
    

## Stat study:


## List of conclusions:

1. Flux fraction morphological prominence is successful overall
2. Candidates identified by prominence could be used for filtering
3. Found general agreement for winding angle of M51 over stable region
4. Normal sampling tool successful in unwinding arms to identify arm interior features
5. Find evidence of colour gradient across arm in M51
6. Normal sampling tool provides a mechanism for proving arm stellar maturity gradient with IFU data


## Text:

In this paper we employ progressive Sérsic profile fitting to create disk subtracted galaxy images of GZ2 spiral galaxies to test the validity of morphological classification from summation of the flux fraction from spiral arms. Spiral arm intensity and colour gradients are investigated at higher resolution using KPNO images of M51 by fitting and sampling normals to create unwound arm images. The conclusions that can be drawn from the resulting analyses are as follows:

\\begin{enumerate}
	\\item Morphological prominence classification of spiral arms is overall successful using FICL and GAX on a data set of spiral galaxies. The technique allows for a quantitative automated classification system for non barred spiral galaxies. In future the technique may be able to be expanded to wider morphologies with updates discussed in section \\ref{sec:Discussion}.
	\\item The flux fraction metric demonstrates the ability to filter spiral galaxy data sets based on the relative brightness of the spiral arms themselves rather than overall feature magnitude. The calculation of which is independent of angular size and locality.
	\\item Spiral Fourier Transform method shows good agreement for the stable region and winding angle of \\textbf{M 51} with quoted values from the literature.
	\\item Normal sampling tool demonstrated to be successful in identification of arm interior features such as dust lanes or arm spurs. 
	\\item Find evidence of colour gradients across the arm of \\textbf{M 51} in agreement with density wave theory, stellar migration and gas compression star formation theory. We estimate that the observed colour gradient is most likely attributed to the dust lanes present within the arm evident in normal sampled unwound arm images.
	\\item Normal sampling tool demonstrates a way to further test the arm$\\rightarrow$shock-front stellar maturity gradient hypothesis. Future study using IFU observations and spectroscopic line ratios will quantify extinction colour contributions for each pixel and provide estimates of local metallicity for stellar population modelling.
