## Things left to do:

- not sure about saying the arms twice in the abstract 
- refer to the metallicity gradient in the colour degeneracy later (see Density Wave Metallicity)
- not convinced on redshift still
- remove the first explore in the abstract
- search and replace disk for disc
- don't like the first phase
- 'The resulting figures plot pitch angle against inner radius in multiples of the effective radius for all harmonic modes next to the effective power of each harmonic mode against the inner radius (see figure \\ref{fig:winding_stability}). ' - Really clunky sentence
- come back to the arm description because it is essentially no good
- 1.3 just say inter arm region instead of compared to
- 'However, the efficiency of star formation throughout a galaxy is constant (SilvaVilla, E. and Larsen, S. S. (2012)).' - yeah so?
- ' the extraction technique' - disk subtraction
- sort out american spellings ----- metre
- 'To ensure locality, and thus sufficient angular resolution, the redshift limit was set to z < 0.085. This maximum redshift, used in Hart et al. (2016), reduces the number of galaxies with large angular size, and any morphological, photometric or spectroscopic complications associated with a large angular size. This redshift limit is the value at which the absolute magnitude limit reaches the sensitivity of the SDSS (?)' - stillneeds work
