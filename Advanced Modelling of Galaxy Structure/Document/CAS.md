- [ ] This concentration index is a number, C, defined as the ratio of the 80%â€“20% curve of growth radii ($r_{80}$, $r_{20}$), within 1.5 times the Petrosian inverted radius at r($\\eta  = 0.2$), normalized by a logarithm; $$C = 5\\,log(r_{80}/ r_{20})$$

- [ ] The asymmetry index is defined as the number computed when a galaxy is rotated 180 degrees from its centre and then subtracted from its pre-rotated image, and the summation of the intensities of the absolute value residuals of this subtraction are compared with the original galaxy flux.

- [ ] The spatial frequency term 'Smoothness' we define as, the clumpiness index ($S$) as the ratio of the amount of light contained in high-frequency structures to the total amount of light in the galaxy. [How do we define high frequency?] -  [ could we do this better using the spiral frequency components?]

'We argue in this paper that the concentration index is a measure of the relative fraction of light in bulge and disk components, i.e., the $B/T$ ratio, and is a measure of the scale of a galaxy, its size, luminosity, and mass. Concentration thus reveals the past formation history of a galaxy. The asymmetry index is shown to be good at identifying galaxies which are currently undergoing major mergers. The clumpiness index is found to correlate very well with the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width of galaxies, and to a lesser degree with the integrated (BV) colour of a galaxy'
