Like celestial brushstrokes on a cosmic canvas, spiral arms paint a mesmerizing picture of galactic beauty, inviting astronomers to explore their intricate nature and role in galactic evolution. In this paper we explore how disk subtraction techniques through progressive SÃ©rsic profile fitting can be used to quantitatively and automatically classify arm prominence in a sample of Galaxy Zoo 2 spiral galaxies. We employ Spiral Fourier Transform techniques to fit spiral arms and normal sampling to unwind the arms to study the colour and intensity distributions across them in high resolution images of M 51. We find general agreement to the trailing edge to leading edge red-blue colour gradients and explore possible mechanisms for the presented distributions.
