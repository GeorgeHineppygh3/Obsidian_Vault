	- Which data set and why
	- the quality and info on the data
	- selection criteria
- Non Parametric Fitting + model subtraction
	- want to show the best spiral fitting process use high save iteration frequency
- Spiral Fourier Transform
	- Identify number of arms
	- identify pitch angle
	- plot spiral fit
- Spiral shock front intensity gradients
	- calculating normals
	- sampling pixels
